From all the time I spent with FO3... I never could have imagined this garbage is what you'd spew up from the depths of whatever 'creative' hell it came from. I thought you would learn from what Obsidian did with New Vegas, more depth - more REALISM.The map is smaller than Skyrim, Todd. Not in length, or width, but in the sense that the little things are missing. The special touch and charm that is just on the cusp of every corner you'd turn in the previous fallout titles is missing... The environment feels hollow, too vibrant, too smooth. It's not the same Fallout theme I grew to crave and felt wonder at. You traded something original, something special, from those wonky shooter mechanics to the skill bar and karma system, for what? better FPS mechanics and a more 'console-friendly' interaction system? I would suggest that all digital copies are wiped and the physical copies piled into a garbage dump like Atari did when E.T. the Extra Terrestrial failed... but I digress...This game should serve as a warning to those who find themselves with an IP as significant as the Fallout Universe.

In my personal opinion the new content  scheme they've borrowed from one of their other games, CS:GO, shows a stark indication of how much damage the newer updates have wreaked on the TF2 community. The new guns/skins look awful, it's a transplant from CS gone wrong. It's a lot more toxic, and competitive in TF2 now, F2P destroyed the quality of an already degrading player base. Idle and achievement servers fill up the server list completely. TF2, we had a good run... but now it's time for this grizzled mercenary to hang up his hats.""}]"

Been a Wolfenstein fan from childhood.Machine Games has managed to mix modern shooter features with the old for a very convincing experience. Solid story line and character development, Wolfenstein NO brings the FPS genre backs to its roots with fast pace action based around combat intensity, excitement and less hyper realism that has overtaken the entire genre as of late. No more ducking for cover every five seconds to regenerate your health. Wolfenstein NO makes good use of HP and Armour pick ups that allows the player to feel more apart of the story rather than just a bystander.I can't rave enough about the gun play in this game, amazing gun selection and design, almost every weapon can be dual-wielded. A good variety of weapons that all have different uses which help foster and encourage different play styles eg. stealth or open combat. This game has put to rest the argument that every FPS must embrace a multiplayer feature. While I hope due to the success of Wolfenstein NO a standalone multiplayer is developed in the future that echos the Enemy Territory model of earlier Wolfenstein games, this game easily stands tall on its singleplayer features alone.With multiple difficulties, different characters and a meaningful collectibles feature that unlocks four very unique gameplay modes, this game has plenty of replay-ability and could easily be enjoyed for many playthroughs. I don't normally like DLC but I really hope this game gets some side mission or extended story line DLC and fingers crossed a sequel in the coming year or two.Hats off to Machine Games for crafting an enjoyable singleplayer FPS in an era where everyone is obsessed with multiplayer and for standing by their development goals till completion to produce a solid product.

This is the thin end of the wedge, and PC gamers should stand together in giving a well deserved collective middle finger to anyone involved in these shabby practices.Oh, and as far as the review goes, I couldn't play the game in VR because Codemasters were bribed into avoiding the de facto OpenVR standard in favour of locking down the hardware with Oculus' proprietory drivers, so....That's a huge thumbs down and a generous 2 testicles/10 rating for this one.

Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering \""should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead\"". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can't really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game).""}, {""funny"": ""1 person found this review funny"", ""posted"": ""Posted December 25, 2015."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited March 17."", ""item_id"": ""252950"", ""helpful"": ""1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Great banter has been had while playing this game. 10/10 would play again.BTW ONLY PLAY WITH CONTROLLLER PC CONTROLS ARE \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665""}, {""funny"": ""2 people found this review funny"", ""posted"": ""Posted May 4."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""318420"", ""helpful"": ""1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""The gameplays relatively the same as the main game but with more focus on branding uruks rather than killing them, but the main attraction is the One Ring which to be fair is OP againts warcheifs and makes them a breeze but i guess thats what the One Ring is, a ring of power.

And to put plainly NMS is kiddy pool infinite in size. Extremely simple and impossible to do more then one or to things with. Although on its own this game would make good early access $30 game, but the slew of missing content raise more questions then answers we have ever got from the Hello Games dev team e.g Planets orbiting, ships class system, naming ships, flight control that isn't a form of dumb down auto pilot, the depth and complexity of the crafting and elements system. Now based on what versions of the games with have seen threw trailers and \""gameplay footage\"", it's looks as if the game has now become extremely simpler then the version we are playing now. Some reddititors have gone threw the footage from E3 and the likes, and have said that what we saw was very likely a real version of the game based some key artifacting that could of easily been removed in a pre baked animation e.g AA although this isn't 100% confirmed yet.This just my opinion, but it looks as if NMS has been effected by its need to run on the PS4, with the potential of Sony pulling strings forcing Hello games making the game simple to reach wider audiences and there for more buyers.With all this in mind it is best to hold on to that $60 USD till one of these things happen:1.

Fun and intriguing with a story that isn't force fed to you. Combat is very precise and very rarely feels cheap or unfair.

Seeing shadows of other players, interacting with their bloodspots on the ground to see how they died, getting summoned to another world to help slay a boss, and getting invaded by other players. PVP battles are incredibly tense, the tactics that worked on NPCs don't always work with players, and you know that the oponent you facing is no novice gamer.

Pro Gamer Manager. Wherein you take the control of a Pro Gamer wannabe with grand aspirations. What I\u2019m going to talk about is a few reasons you should buy the game, and a few reasons you probably shouldn\u2019t. Please note, I don\u2019t have an affiliation with the developer Millenway Studios, this is all from personal experience from game time I\u2019ve had after release which, as of recording is about a day. There may be some words, or terminology that require understanding of MOBA\u2019s in general, if you don\u2019t have that understanding please, ask me to clarify, and I\u2019d be happy to do so.So first off, the game is reminiscent for those that have played a game dev type game. It\u2019s $9.74 USD currently. The first mark I\u2019d put against the game is there\u2019s not really a steam community as of yet. This isn\u2019t a massive mark against the game as it could grow with time and be something that gets larger. However, there\u2019s a very distinct lack of presence from the development team in the Steam forums. That\u2019s something I\u2019d like to see change.Ok, the premise of the game. I personally play a lot of League, but this game will appeal to you regardless of MOBA, although it\u2019s very clearly marketed towards League players. You start as a casual player and seem to gain fans very quickly, while I accept this is intended, it does feel somewhat strange. Personal preference. Moving on. Minor add, lots of spelling mistakes, but it\u2019s a foreign company, so I\u2019d take that with a grain of salt.The first bug I encountered, is the incredibly lackluster menu. The tablet system that explains parts of the game (does it?) and gives you random announcements seems like an ill thought of overlay that doesn\u2019t add anything and instead clutters the screen (which you can still access the base menu while in).Eventually, you\u2019ll come to researching comfort picks. Which is nice. However, if you research the same champion again, instead of adding extra points into understanding an existing comfort pick, it simply creates another entry for the same champion. On top of that, not only does it create a fresh champion, it doesn\u2019t have the same level of played experience. Which is supremely disappointing.Another bug I\u2019ve encountered is also to do with comfort picks. Once you pick your 6th champion as a comfort pick. Selecting them in any game since, will have you selecting your 5th comfort pick. To experiment, I selected a 7th comfort pick champ, and it still picked the 5th.The options menu is completely barren, by which I mean it doesn\u2019t exist. Want to mute your game? Sorry pal, not gonna happen. You have a very sub standard amount of options when you open the game (restricted to what resolution, whether it\u2019s windowed or not, and what monitor it\u2019s displayed on).After playing more and creating a random e-sports league you lose a lot of your individual identity. So I feel it should be clear whether you\u2019re creating a team to be a part of, or creating a team to be the coach of.Basically, after playing the game, I don\u2019t feel as if I have any agency, or any control over my pro gamer path. I\u2019m just doing things, as I see them and if I have enough research then yep, I\u2019m gonna do that. However, the effects of said research aren\u2019t apparent beyond showing up in a profile and certainly aren\u2019t explained through any tutorial.Which leads me to the last thing. A tutorial\u2026 Where is it? This game expects you to understand what\u2019s going on straight from the get go, and if you don\u2019t\u2026. Well it doesn\u2019t actually matter because you\u2019ll still get fans anyway. Any of the choices in game don\u2019t seem to have ANY impact long term, where they really should.As it stands right now, if what I\u2019ve said interests you enough to support the dev team, please do so. If however, what I\u2019ve said has made you consider where you spend your money, I think you are making a smart choice, and when the dev\u2019s decide to make the game both A) true to the experience and B) work, then it will be a good game.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted February 6."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""418070"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""It has pugs in it 9/10It lost a point because it's a game called Turbo Pug that has cats.A legitimate gripe though, having a cursory day/night cycle is fine, but the saw blades are a similar shade to the background making them pretty hard to see.It's fun, in a \""well I've got a few minutes to spare\"" kind of way.

I semed to get hit a hell of a lot yet didnt seem to lose much in the way of health, and I found the constant birage of new spawning enemies somewhat unrealistic. however if you like a tactical run and gun style gameplay with constant enemy attacks to overcome then this is a good game choice.I thought the size of this game was a little on the high end. (above 10gb) but I gues for the age of it and the probable unnecessary programming for the time I cant complain to much. I just wish it had been a bit longer play time for the size.overall, now that I have the sound issue fixed, I found this to be an enjoyable title.

I've owned this game since 2013 back when there were only ~three types of armor with similar graphics and few features of note. It somehow managed to be surprisingly fun then, and it has only gotten better since. The dev('s) put out updates often and the game has undergone fundamental changes since 2013. The squad system, the new worldmap, the new factions, the overhaul of equiptment (eg. the armour I mentioned earlier) - all these things have changed since then and every one of these changes, though I often initially missed the old ways, were for the better.Some will say a sandbox game which has been in early access alpha for two years is neccesarily a lost hope. This game proves otherwise.The game is still a little laggy and may run slow on older rigs, it also occasionally crashes, though the rate of these has fallen drastically since '13.I strongly reccomend this game to anyone interested in a vast, open-world survival RPG where it is the player who creates his/her own story.""}]"

It will ruin the franchise for you.------Post finish update.Well I finished it, and can say it is not possible to die of boredom.Which is a good thing seeing that's what this game is in a nutshell.I even started the post game pivot points hunt, until I realised, why bother. Sure it unlocks cheats, but if turned on, most of them causes your game to reset when you disable them.So I played one round of bowls with George Washington then kissed the main game goodbye. (If by kiss you mean the raising of ones middle finger)*SPOILERS this paragraph only*The game insulted me many times but the best insult was after I chased down Charles Lee. Connor was massivly injured, and I made my way to the frontier, as you may know, you can't run or fight at this point. However, as I'm dragging Connor's broken body towards the inn a notification pops up telling me to attack a convoy! It then tells me the convoy is leaving, followed by a failure to attack said convoy notification. I laughed so hard at this, but not in a good way, in the kind of a way that said, \""You, Ubisoft should never be allowed to forget how bad this stink heap of a notgame your brand name is attached to, and that every person who appears in the 20+ min of credits should hand write an apology to anyone who owns a copy of this...thing.\""Then I tried the DLC game, the Tyranny of King George blah blah whatever.The most amazing thing about this DLC is that I actually had more fun in the first 15 minutes of this than the whole of the main game. Sad really.This was not to last however as I saw that everyone who was noble and good in the main game was now a baddie, and the full sync requirements are even harder. Luckily, the whole story is all just a piece of eden created dream. Which is more than I can say for it.So, after nearly uninstalling Assassin's Creed 3 after the hideous mini game of breaking up the wood mill workers fight, or after being eaten by those wolves at Kidd's treasure Island for the hundreth time (before I used trip mines on the buggers!), or trying, trying and trying again to tackle that officer from above but never succeeding (although I did keep leaping onto his mates for some reason). Instead it was here, after the main game, but only a bit into the DLC I realised I've had enough of a game that isn't actually fun. In fact, after I clicked uninstall I realised how much more fun it was doing that than 90% of Assassin's Creed 3. I should get an achivement for that!My verdict is, watch this as a playthrough on Youtube. If you really need to.Then play Black Flag.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted February 25, 2014."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""550"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""Look.

I've played most of the Tomb Raiders that have come out over the years, however, none have really grabbed my interest as much as this latest entry in the series. I've recently moved back into PC gaming from consoles, and I've played through Uncharted, which I always was sad that non-PS3/Vita owners couldn't play such a game. Tomb Raider remedies this by providing stand out gameplay, skill/weapon customisation, lots of things to find throughout the environment and a good story to boot. This truely is a great fun game and in some ways, it even out-shines the Uncharted series. It feels very much like a cross between an open world RPG and a third-person action game. The way the game plays out is great too, allowing exploration without just pushing the player through the story. You can always backtrack and find things later on. All of those things aside, this game is beautiful and if you've got a decent graphics card/SLI setup, put on the TresFX and check out the amazing fluidity of Lara's hair (it might sound silly but it really adds to the immersion). If you were a bit 50/50 on the old Tomb Raiders or you really liked the series, this is definitely a great reboot to the franchise, check it out!""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted July 16, 2013."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""49520"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Borderlands 2 is great fun, especially with friends.

I get where some of the negative reviewers are coming from, about how now that anybody can get this skin it doesn't feel as \""exclusive\"" anymore, I'd feel the same way, but I thought reviews were about rating a product, not arguing about the fact you don't feel special anymore, which is why I feel as if the \""Mostly Negative\"" rating for the DLC is not really justified.Moving on to reviewing the DLC itself, I really like this skin. It's stylish, elegant, and badass. The armor is well designed, reminiscent of the elvish culture in the Lord of the Rings films, and the hood/cloak combo truly makes for a classic appearance that rivals the default skin. Even if you don't like the skin, it won't be much of a waste of money considering it is only 99 cents. Personally, I love this skin.Well, this review has become too \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing long, so I think I should end it here.

I used to play the demo all the time as a 6 year old to 8 year old kid. Oh, the fond memories of playing this game behind my mother's back because she didn't like of all the violence >_>.Well anyway, I am now an adult, and I have returned to Alien Shooter in order to revisit some of my most fond childhood memories... and thank god that this game is still as good as it was back when I first played it.The game's title is pretty straight-forward, and there's not much more to it then that. You're sent into a military complex all by yourself, which has been infested with aliens. Your job is to stop all of the aliens from escaping and going out into the world to wreck havoc, by mass-murdering every single mother-\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing alien in sight and paint the entire floor and walls with so much blood that the smell would probably be enough to render you unconscious.You start out with your dual-wield pistols, but eventually, you'll unlock a multitude of other weaponry to blow up everything in sight, such as shotguns, miniguns, laser assault rifles, plasma miniguns, rocket launchers, magma guns, and a floating orb buddy who murders everything in sight for you so you don't have to. And I have to say, killing aliens with all of these weapons at your fingertips is surprisingly therapeutic and insanely fun.There are also some minor RPG elements in the game, such as the ability to level up 'skills', the ability to choose your gender, and your name. My favourite part about this game would have to be it's soundtrack. I remember as a kid, upon loading up the game for the first time and hearing the main menu music, it literally sent chills down my spine, and it still does to this day.The only downside to the game I could possibly think of, however, is that the game is very short. I personally finished it in two hours in one sitting, and sadly there is not that much replay value other than survival mode. Overall, the game was very good for it's time, and without a doubt it still holds up today. It is worth your time if you either need something fresh to play, or if you just want to kill some time. If this game is ever on sale, or you have $5 to burn, it is worth a go....or you could just buy Alien Shooter 2.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted April 16, 2015."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited April 16, 2015."", ""item_id"": ""250600"", ""helpful"": ""3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""This game fascinated and intriqued me, to be honest.

This is also one of the only games I have ever bothered to unlock all Achievements for.  If you\u2019re looking to get into stealth games, I recommend you start out with this one. Mark of the Ninja is 2D, and thus, unlike in a 3D Stealth game, this game is able to show you all the information you need on screen at once, making it easier to plot out your next move. This makes the game great for beginners. Plus, the controls are easy to master.This game also supports Ghost/Traditional Stealth and Aggressive Stealth, as well as providing you with a variety of ways to complete your objective, and thus, the game hardly goes stale. Do you want to sneak past all the enemies, using non-lethal tactics, and leaving no trace that you were ever there in the first place? Or do you want to sneak through the level, stalk your enemies, silently assassinate them from the shadows, and become the ultimate predator and master of your environment? Whatever type of stealth your into, this game let\u2019s you do both. Personally, when it comes to Stealth Games, this one in particular, I am a hybrid of both of those playstyles, and that is what I would recommend.The only issue I really had with this game, was the plot. In my opinion, the plot is rather interesting, and it\u2019s nice and tight. But personally, I felt as if they could\u2019ve done more with the story. However, the ending is exceptional, and very well done. I am not going to mention spoilers, don't worry.Overall, this game is very good and satisfactory.

But then, they decided, lets limit that fun. Warriors cannot sprint without putting their weapon on their backs, for some reason, this was implemented, i am assuming to stop people from sprinting into combat swinging? but that couldn't be it, because that would add so much fun to the game.But, probably the worst decision that was made, was to add an energy bar, i guess it is to stop people from swinging a lot, but that's what people wanted from this game, they wanted that fast paced action packed feeling, only to be greeted with absurdly unrealistic limitations. I want to have to block 15-20 swings in a 10 second fight, i want that thrill, that rush, the feeling one might expect from being a viking. But instead we are given a slow game, that makes it feel like we are all terribly hung over warriors, decades past our prime swinging heavy sticks, losing our breath after just a bare few swings. gone are the days warriors trained to endure i guess.I just feel massively let down by this game, i thought it was going to be what war of the roses almost was before it was drenched in honey, making combat slow and boring. Although, the game might have changed? i haven't really been able to play it to test since a few months after it came out, considering how no one plays the game anymore. Its all a massive shame, i had high hopes, now i guess all i can do is wait for mount and blade 2, and hope they don't destroy that too, by catering to the slow of block.did the designers just not want to do new weapons? power strike was awesome, if a 2nd is made, and they keep the energy bar, lets hope they make it so that it only gets drained by sprinting and power strike, its too short a bar, and recovers too slowly for it to be used for everything.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted August 7."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""225540"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""I recommend this game, its so much fun, but i feel bad for people with issues.

Sure, you could buy a warframe and weapons with real cash. But that doesn't mean you're any good at the game. You actually have to take the time to collect mods, upgrade your warframe and weapons. But - if you play enough, you don't have to pay any real money to get platinum (an in-game currency). You can trade with other players to make platinum. Which is fantastic. But doing that takes time. This brings me to farming or grinding. When it comes to having to farm certain mobs to drop a certain recourse or mod, it's actually fun.In summary - the first part of the game may not seem fun. But it gets better. With the various mission types you can do, learning the lore of the Tenno as the story unfolds, the many quests you can do, all the different types of warframe/weapons. Yes I can recommend this.""}]"

I'm only Rank 6/25 (or something like that), but it's a waste of time. All the single-player camos are boring and bad, so it's not even worth it for the camos. If you're looking for a singleplayer experience, this NOT it.ZOMBIESZombies is a classic Treyarch gamemode first introduced in World at War, and even after Black Ops 1 & 2, this is still incredible.. WITH THE SEASON PASS. I cannot stress enough that Zombies is completely useless if you don't have the season pass. Zombies only has 1 MAP w/o the season pass, which is a bit ridiculous, but regardless, if you DO end up getting the season pass, it's well worth it. There are in-depth easter eggs in every single map, with great detail and attention to the story. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A ZOMBIES EXPERIENCE, DO NOT BUY W/O SEASON PASS!MULTIPLAYERMultiplayer is probably the most popular gamemode of the 3, but is a bit of a broken mess. The controller support in this game is so incredibly infuriating it makes me want to leap off of a building, and the aim assist is the cause of the problem (instead of having a rant about why the aim assist is so \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed, I'm going to continue). The season pass for Black Ops 3 on PC for Multiplayer only is probably the biggest waste of money ever, as nobody plays the DLC after a few days of release. Though they have started to intergrate the DLC maps into the normal map pool, it's still a bit of a waste.SUPPLY DROP RANT / END OF MULTIPLAYER SEGMENTSupply drops are the worst thing to happen to Call of Duty ever. Activision has \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ed over all Call of Duty games since Advanced Warfare (which I got \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing VAC'd on) with micro-transactions, or \""COD Points\"". These COD Points can be used on Extra camos and Supply Drops (as of 1/9/16 [D/M/Y]). Supply drops are basically CSGO cases, but instead of getting one item, you get 3 (but you can actually trade in CSGO unlike this game). Supply drops can be earned in-game with Cryptokeys (which can be acquired by playing the game), and you have the choice of a Common Supply Drop, or a Rare Supply Drop. Only Rare Supply Drops can be bought with COD Points, and Rare Supply Drops give you a better chance for rare items. There are probably around 25 of them right now, with half of them being Melee Weapons. It's extremely rare to get these items with Common Supply Drops. And this is the part that pisses me off the most. YOU CAN GET DUPLICATES. Duplicates can be burned for more Cryptokeys, with Common being burned for 1 Cryptokey, Rare being burned for 3 Cryptokeys, Legendaries being burned for 7 Cryptokeys and Epic's being burned for 10 Cryptokeys. So if you get a Black Market weapon you already have.. well then \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you, because you can only burn it for 10 or 7 cryptokeys. The gameplay in multiplayer is OK and the community is toxic (you might want to rebind some keys). If you're looking for a multiplayer only experience, I would recommend buying the multiplayer starter pack (which only includes multiplayer and some restrictions, but you can upgrade to the full game whenever).I would NOT recommend this game if you are a veteran at Call of Duty, because the \""Exos\"" are ridiculous.OVERALLCall of Duty: Black Ops III is an OK game with great developers working on a terrible PC port. I can't help but feel that this platform (PC) is a third-wheel to the COD franchise, with every year having terrible PC ports and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 performance. If you're in it for the gameplay, buy the Multiplayer Starter Pack, if you don't like it, then refund it, if you like it, upgrade and buy the full game.I would rate this game 8/10 on consoles, since it's not so bad bugs & performance wise, but this is PC.I rate this game 7/10 (with Season Pass).I rate this game 5/10 (without Season Pass).""}, {""funny"": ""1 person found this review funny"", ""posted"": ""Posted June 4, 2015."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""333930"", ""helpful"": ""2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Guy got mad at me for not completing an objective, shortly after that, the server crashed. 10.5/10.

So I find a guy, he tries talking on his mic but hes not saying anything.I run into a small area above these plots, looked like they were going to build houses there. I run inside a trailer and hear something outside.... Immediatley two guys are conversating on there mics, I then hide in the bathroom of this little trailer.... I hear two gunshots and hear other people on mics. I exit out of the back and run for the woods....I come upon a small little neighborhood, theres three guys terrorizing another guy, I thought id save him. I got blown up....Me and a friend make plans to go to.... D5, It sayd there was a police station there so all I could think of was guns, lets get our hands on guns.... We travel towards D5 from I7, so were walking through the hills and such, all of a sudden we come upon a house, its pitch black and this house is near a pond. We watch around us and zombies start pilling up. We start heading back to D5 now, we come upon a river and theres 30+ player made bases. We can see this massive town (at the time I didnt know D5 was a massive town, I just thought it was a police station XD  ) So were running towards the town, I hear a gunshot and I got killed. My friend panicked and ran towards the apartments. Atm im thinking of quitting the game, I got killed and itd take me FOREVER to get back here again.... My friend hides in an apartment.So I go to click Respawn and lord and behold, I respawned in D5... Right next to the apartment my friend was in. We found some guns in the apartment. Were running down the street and we look behind us and theres 20 guys with guns and helmets running and shooting at us. We got cornerd, tourtured, and murderd... My friend decided to get off and I respawn next to a gas station, I was then held at gunpoint and asked to take mt clothes off.. Hes ready to pull the trigger and all of a sudden a car comes out of nowhere and runs him over. I then hop in the car and the battery dies and we got cornerd by the group of 20 people...... R.I.P Car Dude...To end this little thing, the next day I decided to play some more H1Z1, I find a zombie and he has an ak47, helmet, awesome pants, and a sick backpack with alot of supplies on him.... Thank god for player zombies :DId recomend this game to my future kids... oh yeah, Im not even married yet..10/10 Id go thru all this hell again just to find the police station...P.S, I still dont know where it is, I got lost then run over by a car in D5.....""}, {""funny"": ""1 person found this review funny"", ""posted"": ""Posted April 24."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited April 25."", ""item_id"": ""282560"", ""helpful"": ""7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Im loving every single minute of it, glad I bought it, only *issue* ive run into is when the park reaches 2,000+ peeps, the lag is unberable, and it crashes.

This game is by far, one of the best releases Steam has had in a long, long time. If you're into survival games, and need something to play that isn't the same old crap that is flooding the Steam games page, this is exactly what you're looking for.So the game is an \""open-world\"" survival, full of dinosaurs, the developers are commited, the updates are many and vast, it's quite rare that you see an \""Early Access\"" get followed through with by the developers and actually improved, most of them seem to just give up halfway through and stop development. But enough about the development end of this game (High five to the developers though, you're fantastic.) Let's move on to the actual gameplay and mechanics of this game.To start with, you spawn somewhere on an Island (Future maps are comming out, also a moddable game so go nuts.) with nothing but the underwear covering your \u2665\u2665\u2665 and a chip in your arm. From there you punch a tree to get wood and thatch, collect rocks, and build your first primitive tool. After that the world is yours, if you wish you can go punch a Dodo in the face and make it your pet (Or if you're like me, you tame every Dodo you can find and amass an army to take over the Island. The Dodo King shall reign supreme!). It's very much a \""do what you wish, not what you have to\"" kind of game. If you want you can climb the Tech-Tree, building newer and better things, but it isn't necessary, you can simply go around raiding other people for tools if you wish, or if you're smart enough, kill some dino's and they drop stuff. If you're too lazy for that, go find a cave and run for your life through it until you find a supply crate (Supply crates are drops that land around the world, they're always full of goodies.)This is by far one of the best games I've seen on Steam in many many years, if you haven't bought it, do it now.

From a glance it boasts nice graphics, decent amount of content and a well-crafted combat system. However, I can assure you it\u2019s also offers a beautiful fantasy world that has completely engrossing likeable characters with tonnes of side quest (With all DLC).  I\u2019ll admit playing with PC controls can be somewhat challenging, however the controller settings are an utter breeze. The game has a vast range of unique weaponry and armour available, which makes every task, every hidden object, and every enemy slain feel greatly more rewarding. The only complaint I have in relation to this game, is the item limit, it can be a royal pain when you\u2019re collecting different sets to switch between. Aside from your abilities and destinies there are various skills to upgrade:  Alchemy, blacksmithing, detect hidden, dispelling, lock picking, mercantile, persuasion, sagecraft and stealth, which are upgradable from basic to master. These enable you to interact better within quests or be worse off depending on which you focus on. Persuasion can make all the difference when getting caught out in committing an offence against the town, as can lock picking as you\u2019d probably guess why.  With the availability of the Fate Weaver it is easy to respec at any given time to get a different experience from the game which holds ones interest for longer than a one route only game. I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to compare Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning to Skyrim, however, it\u2019d definitely be my next choice from it. 8/10 Incredibly solid game.""}, {""funny"": ""6 people found this review funny"", ""posted"": ""Posted August 25."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""393980"", ""helpful"": ""22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""My friends are questioning what I'm doing with my life.

Extraordinary.Cities: Skylines not only offers breath taking visuals, it also features captivating game play by implementing the most moddable options we've seen in a city sim to date.

Ever play a city sim where some buildings are not to your liking, require too much space or you just don\u2019t like the general set out of them? Not anymore, you can change absolutely everything to suit your preferences and gameplay style. Once you get taken into your citizen\u2019s messages via chirper it is unbelievably easy to lose time whilst playing this game. I cannot tell you how much time I\u2019ve spent re-routing traffic in order to get it working smoothly, so don\u2019t be surprised if a quick fix for heavy traffic areas become a grand plan that takes more than the quick couple of minutes you had anticipated before starting.

I'm sure a story that is shockingly real to many people, which makes it so so easy to relate to.Probably not for those who don't enjoy 'interactive stories.'""}]"

I picked London because it looked like a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 hole compared to the others and I want the feeling of looking foward to going to a nice bohama island in the future of playing this game. When i started playing this game around say 50 minutes ago I had no clue what to do and still very much the same but that will soon vanish. The gameplay to this is very complex, reminds me far to much of everquest gameplay. Every little tiny bit of content just seems to carry more content and complexity and I love that! It feels like you achieve somthing everytime you complete a new task or a new skill!There is no auction house :'( which is the only dissapointment I have atm, but as suffisicated as this game is they make you the auction house! You must bargain with other player, sell your good's and make an absolute fortune or even make your self titled as king merchent.The graphics are nice :) The content is insane! I have been told there are easily over 500 ships in this game and each one can be designed by you! With over 1000 decoration pieces it seems rare to spot a twin of you're ship :'). I allways spot people wearing different clothing and different weapons. Its rare to spot someone looking the same as someone else. Unless of coure you are a noob liek me and are still wearing you're student uniform :p.The world map is our world map. The uncharted waters page on steam simply states there are over 180 locations to be explored including the entire ocean. Last of all the community! I have not been in a kinder comunity ever! as soon as i hopped on world chat I was warned about certain people camping at certain spots waiting to kill other people. But hey I was told by a group of people that they would protect me! and help me out if i ever get attacked and one of my new friends said if i ever want a player killed that i should tell him ;). Soi yes in under an hour I have now made two new friends :S. I was also offered one million dollars from each player I was talking to in the world chat <3.I cant wait to explore and venture forth through out this game even more!

Gun Craft includes numerouse modes like lava survival, Meteorite survival, TDM. FFA etc. Also come with its own customisation tool which is probably the highlight of this game.Otherwise this game lacks in fun.TDM: Its lame! Probably doesnt help when there are no one on servers any more :p, you just run around shoot be shot and then killed feels like COD, but strangely less fun than COD. O-O.Meteorite survival: I acctually liked this one, allthough yet again all servers are dead and the most amount of people I played with was two, the other guy and I.Lava survival: The lava takes a full Ten Minutes to rise to the top, and with all the helicopters and some hover bikes offered right away in lava survival it isnt that hard to get access to high places. When everyone is at a high place you can shoot them but not kill them, they only turn into snow men, once a snowman you shall not move for seven seconds and immediately after yur turn from being a snowman back into a human you're apponent is allowed to shoot and kill you again 2 seconds afterwards, then you are a snow man again for another seven seconds! And yes they can continue to do this >:(. So that sums lava survival up for you, get to a high place turn each other into snowmen for ten minutes, once lava rises close build two blocks higher to survive like what the other person did aswell lava rises to the max. Boom! Both of you have had a Draw YAY!What else do I need to talk about?!?! Oh yes the build tool!The build tool consist of you running away from enemy urgently wanting to get out of fire, you must press B then you are given blocks and you can build you're escape, but wait you want to do some moe damage to the opponent so you have to switch from build mode back to attack mode. Then you;re health is low so you want to escape again so you continue a exceedingly slow build! After you place one block you must wait a unecessary 3 seconds ?! By now you have allready been killed, if only the building was faster and you didnt have to switch from build mode to kill mode in the middle of a shoot out, as this is very frustrating.Dont even get me started on the grapple which gets you Fing nowhere!Overall I have had two fun games, a sequall would be cool, if they improved the features.I rate this game a 4/10, it was worth the summer sale price :D""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted March 5, 2014."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""239220"", ""helpful"": ""6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""The Mighty Quest For Epic Loot, is a grand hack and slash, humourous birds eye view ftp game with plenty of potential to come in with further updates (Its a beta).

It can sometimes feel the same thing over and over again with nothing unique to make it feel different, apart from a few new enemie types.Is it really a quest for loot? In my opinion not really unless you are continueousley searching for gold, or the life crystals. There is barely any gear whats so ever, unlike the torchlight series or titan quest. On the very first castle raid I found the same mage cuff (Glove) five times! and one or two different staff's and a piece of clothing. And you will find the same items for that region :(. It is only in beta I understand hopefully they do bring out more gear :D.You get to customize your own castle which I think is epic and the tutorial is so simple making it very east to understand :D.Classes you either get a Mage,Archer,Warrior and some barbarian chick, they all look cool and I wish to play as them all !

Also, some creatures attacks should not always be an outright elimination of Aura (such as the boars attacks removing an improved Aura bar completely, when they do that normally). Apart from that, I can't think of many other improvements that you haven't thought of already (such as more levels and characters). So I will leave this review with the fact that this game is incredibly fun and entertaining, but it needs improvements, and I assume they will be made further down the line, and so would like to thank you for them.

This game is great and all, However there are things that I don't like. I happen to be a person who likes to 100% games with achievements and all, and having to go back and forth through multiple areas multiple times just gets painful. I forget that I am indeed able to die, and just run through like I'm god, forgetting about my gun and shield. I have also found a few glitches here and there. Once, I was able to go on the water at the beginning, before I had the ability to, accessing an area I shouldn't have been able to otherwise. I also managed to get myself glitched in the wall at the third boss. Not able to die, teleport or go back, I had the reset, doing the entire place again as well as the boss.

Game is fun, but randoms aren't fun to play with. Get a group of friends go into a match and pray you don't get somebody who is abusive for little to no reason. It says I recommend, but my opinion is entirely 50/50. There is a TL:DR down below, I'm just going to have a rantThis game has it highs and a lot of lows. The first game of the day you play might be pretty good. You might get on a team that is rather friendly and you have a good match, you play well, everyone says GG and you leave feeling like you really accomplished something no matter if you win or lose. That is the game trying to lull you in a sense of trust and happiness when it decides to throw a massive hardball of a game that'll leave you with more stress than if you ran a marathon while carting a wheel barrow. After that you might do a few things. 1: Retaliate. They might have the right to get SLIGHTLY annoyed, but clearly their reaction is like they have a wasp trapped inside their room and they are freaking out. They're opinion honestly doesn't matter and sometimes even trying to talk to them in a calm matter is utterly futile. I would not reacting and ignore what they say, because all you're doing is adding to your stress. Also when you react, they usually start to feel justified in their actions and start to pile it on. When you react we all lose. Think of those people as Nukes, because once they are set off we are all going down. Mutually Asssured Depression2: Try to redeem yourself in the next game you'll play. It is highly recommended you avoid doing this at all costs. You might want to prove it to yourself, that you can play good. Don't. Clear your head, relax and find something else to pass the time, until you find yourself in a calm mood. Heck, I'm doing it as I write this because I might be the guy who starts yelling at somebody who doesn't deserve it. Instead I'm issuing a warning to all the people who are unfamiliar with MOBA's and want to try them. This goes for all online games actually. Single player games don't yell at you for making 1 mistake. Except Animal Crossing, Mr.Resetti will give a mean scolding if you turn of your game without saving.This is a perfect summary of the experiences I have had playing this fun game with a rather toxic community. Espicially the people who are immediately racist to anybody that speaks another language. Some people should just change their name to Klu Klux Ken or something.TL:DRGame's fun, people suck, I'm an \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 too (I just happen to not be vocal about it) and play undertale or something.

This can mean learning the economics of the game, from nade usage to shooting and compnesating spray control. As you progress you will start to learn these things. Learning is what makes this game longer-lasting and more enjoyable than other first-person shooters. Popular Gamemodes  Bomb Defusal This is a gamemode with the main objective where the Counter-Terrorists try to prevent the Terrorists from planting at either Bomb sites A or B. There are 2 ways that will give you victory, as Counter-Terrorists you can eliminate the enemy team or defuse the bomb before it explodes. When playing as Terrorist you can win doing the same thing as the Counter-Terrorists which is eliminating the enemy team or planting the bomb and letting it explode. Hostage Rescue A gamemode which has hostages that are placed where the Terrorist spawn, same concept with the wiping out enemy team but instead of the Terrorists objective to plant the bomb, it is the Counter-Terrorist to rescue the hostages and take them back to where the Counter-Terrorists spawn. Custom Gamemodes Lastly in Counter Strike: Source you will be seeing a lot of custom maps and servers which make up majority of the servers nowadays. These gamemodes go from minigames to bhop and surf with plenty of other custom gamemodes to chose from. Custom gamemodes are especially fun to play when you are bored or just looking for something to play with your mates. Conclusion Well worth buying it if it goes on sale a little bit cheaper as it is a little old and not worth the $20 at the moment. Worth all the 200+ hours on this game however there aren't as much servers as they use to be because it is getting old and there are mods that are available which are a load of fun to play such as Jailbreak and Zombies. Hands down the best game for its time and maybe even today (at least for me). I do recommend this game to those who are thinking of purchasing it although you better purchase it soon as servers are getting wiped. Although if you are still wanting the Counter Strike Experience you can switch over to CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive). Its a good alternative but I still prefer Counter Strike: Source over it9.5/10""}]"

Who knew?Things to be aware of - money and ammunition is shared (and so are weapons if you start mounting any on auto turrets - keep an eye on the store count - those are the ones you are using in your team - replace them if you use them or switch to other weapons).  Zombies love attacking barricades but they are usually too dumb to go through a diagonal gap - use that to your advantage.Also remember you can only build/buy during the day.  At night you fight the zombie horde which gets more powerful as you survive each night and the zombies can drop health, ammunition, and bonus cash.  Just don't get yourself killed trying to get it in the later nights!So far I've played solo and with one other in multiplayer.  I'm looking forward to trying this in three and four player multiplayer next.  Should be a hoot.""}]"

Still waiting on things that were promised before the beta was released, features that were fairly basic and should have been in the game.

Empty space as far as the eye can see.The overworld is plain in the visuals, composed of a TON of black space with nothing to provide any sort of visual stimulation. The 'puzzles', which are touted as a large portion of the game, and are frequently referenced by characters in game, are lackluster, unchallenging, time-wasting and unsatisfying. A few characters are absolutely delightful, but in a game that has about 8 main characters, 3 of them I found endearing, 2 were bland or just tolerable, and 3 were downright annoying.The art style is very inconsistent when it comes to several of the characters. I know this was a game made by several people, but when one character looks detailed and in depth and another looks like they were drawn in MS paint it makes me wonder if these were just placeholder characters who the developers never playtested through and realised they needed to fix, or if it was just laziness on their part.On all I enjoyed the destination, the ending of the game was refreshing, but the journey was a horrible bumpy road along a stretch of empty desert in a car with an annoying dog that pukes once every few minutes.Overall I absolutely adored 30% of this game, and didn't like 70% of the rest.

Mass Effect 1 is an excellent game that's aged pretty well, though there are still some hiccups here and there.Pros:-An immersive story where most choices have long-standing consequences. These range from fairly obvious galactic-scale choices to something as seemingly inconsequential as chatting with a particular NPC. While not all of these are terribly important, it really gives a sense of connectivity between games. People don't just forget how you treated them in the past.-The planetary exploration system. While it's unfortunately coupled with the horrible Mako controls (talked about in more detail below), this is one often-derided part of the game that I actually enjoyed. By having a planet in nearly every system that you can get down and explore (rather than just scanning from your ship, as in later games) makes the galaxy seem that much more massive.-The universe itself. Like most Bioware RPGs, the universe of the game is incredibly fleshed out. You'll discover hundreds of 'codex entries', which are little articles which describe how things work in-universe. Everything from spaceship design, to FTL travel, to how certain aliens function is covered at some point or another. This is all optional, of course- you don't *have* to know any of it to play the game, but it really enhances the experience when you can see how much thought went into creating this world.Cons:-The inventory system is... not great. I've seen worse, even in AAA titles, but this one is pretty bad. Your inventory will quickly become cluttered with mostly useless junk, with only a few things worth keeping. This does a good job of fleshing out the world somewhat (most things have a small description or at least a logo, making the galaxy feel bigger), but at the cost of convenience. You practically have to micromanage your squadmate's armor and guns for the first half of the game or so. Once you get access to the really good stuff, everything else becomes pretty much obsolete. Credits become kind of superfulous at the end of the game as well- I maxed out my bank on my first run without even really trying.-The dreaded Mako. It's essentially an armored vehicle for planetary exploration. Sounds great, right? The problem is that the handling is utterly atrocious. The thing lumbers around like a drunken rhinocerous, until it gets stuck on a rock outcropping and flies halfway across the map. It's all right to drive on a flat surface, but most planets are at least somewhat mountainous. There are even a few that are almost nothing but hills. Once again, this adds character to the planets at the expense of gameplay. Everything else:-The combat's nothing special. Not bad, mind you, but it doesn't do a whole lot that's really unique. Third-person shooting from behind chest-high walls with some different powers to liven things up. These range from hacking robotic enemies or weapons to 'biotic' powers which are essentially Force moves. The AI for enemies can get a bit stupid at times with characters running straight into your ambushes. -The graphics are good. A lot of the planetary environments are still beautiful, but some of the characters can get off-model mid-cutscene which makes things pretty jarring. Overall, I'd rate this a solid 9/10. Good combat, if nothing new, coupled with a wonderfully rich environment, engaging characters, and long-lasting consequences that will follow you through the trilogy.""}]"

Honestly, Magicka 2 so far has been a great experience so far, though I am only up to the third chapter. This game continues on with the humor and chaos from the first game and even in single-player I haven't felt a death was unfair or unwarranted, even on the Hard difficulty. That said, I haven't played the hardest difficulty (Bananas) yet. That said, you will probably end up dying a lot if playing by yourself, as the enemies are tougher in this game.The only part about this game that I disliked is the fact that Steam and Ice are no longer their own elements, since the game is built on the same engine as Wizard Wars. However in my mind this is a small price to pay for a release that, so far, is no where near as riddled with bugs.While I have only unlocked a small number of them so far, the new artifacts system allows you to customise your gameplay experience. I foresee myself replaying Magicka 2 more than the first game because of this.TL;DR Magicka 2 is a great successor to an already great game. While it lacks a few things from the first game, the new additions more than make up for the losses.""}]"

This is mainly due to the broken graphics and AI in some cases, but I love it. I love the ideas that it employs, such as RP-aimed features and decent race customisation options. That being said, if you really want to enjoy SEV, your going to need to use mods. While the modding community is pretty much dead, you can still find some good ones on spaceempires.net . This is made easier by the fact that the game has native mod support for drag-installation into a 'gamemodes' folder (in a game from 2006!). Unfortunately, one can only be selected at a time. I am yet to find a program that automatically merges textfiles and still have themwork ingame (though I didn't search very hard (if at all)), so if you want to use multiple mods, you will need to manually go into the files (something like notepad) and combine the differences (though I usually just replace the smaller folder with the larger one, because I'm slack). While this is a hair-splitting process in itself, it's not uncommon for there to still be conflicts after your done anyway, not to mention that the files can actually be very large, meaning it can take a fair few hours depending on what you're doing (if you're commited enough to actually finish merging them and not resort to my way).Anyway, there are also still a few tutorials on mod creation and modifying game files out there for any interested, which is nice. Oh yeah, before I forget, make sure to play the game windowed if you don't want to experience unplayable white-screening. This is one of the fairly common graphical bugs with the SE5, but to be honest, these didn't bother me very much. The AI isn't great, either, which is usually one of the features people critisize the game on, but there are a fair few improvement mods out there incorperated into total conversions and the like, which is the type of mod you'll be finding most of the time anyway. Overall, while SE5 definately isn't for everyone, it may charm those who are looking for a fairly old-school 4X and don't mind using hastilly-patched together modpacks.

You manage her class schedules which will increase her skills in different areas, but you must also keep track of her mood which can affect how easily she learns certain skills. These skills will become vital as they are frequently checked in events throughout the game. Failing these tests can have consequences that range from not gaining certain dialogue options to instant death.That's the gist of it, but as you play you realize the events of the game look far more complex than it seems. A single decision can have implications several weeks down the line, sometimes interacting with several other factors that railroad you to your death. Adding to the complexity is that sometimes the game checks for skills that didn't seem superficially necessary to an event. And sometimes these checks are STEEP to the point where you'd pretty much need to have been planning to go for them from the start.Then again, you can save and load at nearly any point in the game. Hope you've been taking notes or have a good memory. Would recommend that you only begin using a guide after the first 5 or so deaths or if you're hunting odd achievements.There is often more than one way to skin a cat - for example, you could negotiate a compromise with an invading army to back away, or utilize an alliance to intimidate them into doing so. You're not entirely hosed for neglecting a certain skill set, but you'd better make sure whatever you've invested in is appropriately polished. And because you never have enough time to max everything out, there's a constant possibility of what happens if you resolve certain conflicts in different ways, and the challenge of managing your skills and mood such that they're up to standard when the time comes. A singe complete playthrough takes about 2 hours to accomplish, but be assured you'll spend even more time exploring other events the game has to offer.9/10.

Your choices don't mattter - the game revels in not giving you any control over what happens, and then blaming you for every character's constant failures. And its frustrating, because the game starts strong with well-written and well-voiced protagonists. But because its using a licensed property, nothing you can do can impact on the world. And that's REALLY frustating when the antagonist is already a cannon character. Apart from that - the game engine is hideous, the dialogue choices feel limited, the writing has new characters feel like cartoonish characatures, and all gameplay is either pressing a direction for movement, repeatedly pressing q then e or walking around for 2 minute spurts.

Spelunky is a masterpiece of puzzle design and exploration. This is a game that literally changes genre as you get better at it, making it so, so hard to get tired of. When you start its just an overly difficult puzzle platformer, but once you realise the world has extremely consistent rules and patterns, deeper the rabbit hole goes. Bats become moving bouncy platforms, giant horrifying spiders become sticky-web vendors and rats become the ultimate trap-triggering, arrow baning godscend. It's a VERY steep learning curve, and not everyone will get past the frustrating amount of platforming precision required. Spelunky will break you many, many times.

The game is good, although it overdoes combat a bit and does not have any real exploration apart from a few optional tombs. Nonetheless, there are a few fantastic moments where the map opens up and you're unleashed into a playground, ready to take out some bad dudes.

While the sense of abject fear and its triggers can vary from person to person, I found this game does very little in the way of actually attempting to scare you. The majority of the game is spent fumbling around in the titular machine looking for the next gate or doorway that the game has opened for you, while solving puzzles you fail to see the purpose of, as well as following a story the game refuses to explain to you. The monsters are not scary as you're not punished for looking at them, and you pretty much know what they are and why they exist from the start. There's a lacking fear of the unknown to their presence really.The game didn't really fool me - perhaps I've played too many games, but I could pretty accurately determine whether or not I should expect a monster, and the majority  of the time I did not, and nothing appeared.

Whilst its number of options and pathways is comparatively limited, Dishonered does a fantastic job of letting the player feel like they're playing their own way rather than playing from a set list of options. Whilst every encounter still feels based on the standard 'stealth until caught' monikier, you're given a lot of toys that really colour every level's detailed high-rising rooftops, awesome-yet-impractical mechanical foundations and its seedy rat-infested underbelly. Dishonered doesn't have a fantastic story (it's actually pretty trite), but its setting is fantastic and every area feels designed with actual city architecture and infrustructure in mind. Scuttling through seemingly-clean bakeries inside a rat or sneaking through filtration vents as murderous angler fish provide alternate routes that feel a part of the world and not convinient security holes. Dunwall is a 'Whalepunk' empire of Victorian routes with excessive wealth and crumbling poverty-striken foundations. One moment you're challenging a duke to a duel outside of a fancy party, the next you're poisoning water at a gang-owned rundown textile mill for a crazy old lady called \""Granny Rags.\"" Whilst there is definitely more room in future sequels for more unique environments, Dishonered feels like a decent tour of a bizarre and gritty world.It does lose its pacing towards the end, but Dishonered still feels like a funtastic romp through a miserable metropolis.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted July 8, 2013."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""203810"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""A boring and somewhat pretentious museum that thinks that flowery pose equals depth.

The sad part is that lots of people like me bought the premium edition, which is by no means cheap, and most people would think that doing so would allow them some sort of special rights when it comes to DLC, usually in the form of a discount or early play. That way, eventually everyone will still get to play it. Dropping it completely is not only a foolish choice as a developer, but unfair on the whole community plus those that went the extra mile to be cut short. TL;DR \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you NRS, and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you WB. Greedy scumbags. If I could get this refunded, I would, and would recommend everyone else did too.

I went on the forum and there were a lot of discussions about peoples wanting fights, etc. what is pretty easy to put in, since the engine of this game is the same they use on the last 20 years for all kind of rts, but looks like everyone reject this because the public of the game are people tired of war rts and just wanna a nice medieval (im not sure if its medieval, maybe the game take place on the first years of united states colonization?) simulator.This said, i find particullary annoying that the game dont have even robbers and such. Also ok, some peoples dont like wars, but it was a common place at the age the game pass on (even if the game take place on the new world, the natives would be a problem), but ok, i respect the creator for not doing something that players could just switch off if they wanted (like you can choose do with disasters and harsh climate), and why i respect it? Because its his choice, not because he is incompetent (i hope), thats what usually happens when something goes missing on any game.I dont know if he keep updating it, probably not, since the game is bug free since i know and he already had put everything he wanted. Still, i hope he find a way to make the game more fun, but probably it will keep the way its now.

Frozen synapse wouldnt had any need for campaign too, but it has, and its pretty nice. Shamefull few peoples played it (there is an achievment about finalizing the game that there had less than 1% of completion), and i can say that if peoples played more the campaign, the game would have more public. I mean, TF2 wouldnt be the most played online FPS if valve didnt invested so much making videos, comics, etc.Problem is, as i can see, the creators arent putting it on this stage because the game isnt developed. My advice is that they make at least a small campaign (six missions) at first and make another ones when the game advance. I cant find anyone to play online, i didnt see any artwork on the community, i guess with a campaign this would be solved a bit. This said, i shouldnt recommend the game right now, maybe in one year i change my mind... actually i would HOPE for it, because i like this kind of game, but i will positivate it because till now its is one of the few turn based games that didnt killed me in boredoon.""}]"

Unfortunately they have not. The core of the gameplay, attacking and blocking the opposition is still broken to the point that the game is not fun, but provides a frustrating experience.It creates anger every time you play it becuase the game field is not fair. Everything feels slow and clunky becuase all the servers lag so badly. Some are better than others, but in the end, those with the best pings will dominate. It is not uncommon to die 10 times and only get 1 kill becuase the lag is so bad. Your actions on screen are not registered and all you end up doing is getting killed unfairly as hits go through your block. This repeats every match, every game.If Torn Banner actually cared about the game, they would have attempted to fix it after all these years instead of making a DLC for it. I cannot recommed this game to anyone, not even when it is on sale as I feel like I should be entitled to a refund. It is not fun nor challenging. It just provides hours of frustration while taking your money and wasting your time.""}]"

(move to an area, capture all points, Start anarchy)However, even through its clear flaws, I'd still say this game is worth giving a shot.

I loved the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of the First Homefront, And i really wanted to know about other areas of the same universe (Number one was set in sanfran, 2 is set in Philly). The ending of the game was a little satisfying. But lack of audio made it kind of dull. But, there is no awesome soundtrack in war. So in conclusion:GET THIS GAME IF EITHER:+You are a homefront fan+You're looking for a story based around anarchy and revolution+If you dont mind doing reptitive things (I didnt in the case of this game)+Looking for something to get you motivated to shoot something. DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF:-You want Smooth gameplay-You want Smooth Mechanics-Half-\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 soundtrack-Repetitve tasksOn one final note: Guys and Girls, you need to play this game for the STORY, not the actual GAMEPLAY.Happy gaming!""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted February 19, 2015."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""351570"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Was a good watch.

It has a nonsensical story that is neither as sophisticated as it thinks it is, nor as interesting as it tries to be.  Its music and art assets are frequently recycled throughout the entire game. It currently has barely 2 hours of game content, which is encased in a platform that seeks to draw out the experience over 3-4 hours through the use of confusing level design.Then there's the glitches, like being unable to interact with in-game items that are necessary for you to proceed further, causing you to have to reload your game. The worst part, and perhaps the most insulting thing about Hektor, is that it isn't scary at all. Outlast was scary, Alien Isolation was a stressful and harrowing experience. Hektor? Hektor is a complete disgrace to the horror genre of games. Watch any of the lets-plays that are currently on Youtube. Not a single one of them is enthralling, immersive, or in the least bit frightening. Many claim that the game's atmosphere is intensely creepy, and that they would prefer a game like Hektor to one filled with jump scares. Sure, jump scares alone do not make a horror game. Neither do games that are all about the long drawn out creepy atmospheres that eventually amount to nothing. You can only play so much of Hektor before you feel cheated and violated, like the boy who is strung along by a candy man with all the promises of a sweet future, only to end up in the back of a windowless van. No, there is nothing causing that sound that appears to be made by the wheels of hospital beds rolling across the corridor. Its just one of the many sound assets that the game randomly plays every now and then to build up 'atmosphere'. In fact, I haven't seen a single hospital bed move in this game. How about those creaks and groans and that squeaky violin sound you hear as the background music reaches its crescendo? Yup, just more of the same. Sounds with no force of a credible threat behind them. And do you know why there is no hiding in this game? Because there is no need to - the game is a bloody walking simulator. The only threats in Hektor reside in the creatures that you will encounter in this game, and what a disappointment they are.The developers advertise this game as having a horrific monster that tirelessly pursues you. Yes there is only one monster in the game capable of killing you. But the only times you experience being chased by this presence is halfway through the game when you first come across it, and towards the end when the game artificially ramps up its difficulty level by putting the creature in your path. Beyond those two occasions, you almost never encounter the creature, much less get 'pursued' by it. Additionally, it is difficult to be afraid of a monster that has pathing issues. There was one occasion when the monster ran continuously into a box that was in front of me as it tried to get at me. Besides this monster, the game scatters, with no logical rhyme or reason, half naked deathly pale people around the map. These death-camp prisoner of war lookalikes cannot hurt you physically, but are capable of reducing your character's sanity level if you are near them when they scream. The first time you encounter one of these people is a decently shocking experience, but towards the later part of the game, their presence is at best an irritating encounter as the game uses the same audio asset for their screams, and at worst you might end up laughing in their face, especially when you see their ridiculous transition from person into a reddish spectre. Who are these people-like things? What is that monster that chases you? What is the Hektor program? Who are you? Why are you at the facility? How did you come to develop your psychosis? Why do you guzzle antipsychotic medications like M&Ms? You'd probably have a better chance of getting that information from God than this game. In fact, Hektor hardly explains anything properly. The game conveys its tale singularly through badly written journal or diary entries that are randomly distributed throughout the entire level in a humdrum and erratic manner.  Walk into the intelligence room for the first time, pick up a journal entry. Walk into the intelligence room again at a later time, great there are 2 more journal entries to pick up. What the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 is this? Shouldn't the intelligence room be empty now given that I have just explored it earlier? The entire attempt feels so lazy, so half-hearted. It destroys any remaining immersion that one might have in the game up to this point. The main story is simplistic. It is also full of boring cliches. How many times can we pretend to be interested in the stories told by the people who eventually develop the 'crazies', or some aggravated form of 'stockholm' syndrome? Leave that for the bad movies, it is their rightful domain. You are supposed to be making a horror game that scares us, unnerves us, that makes the hairs on our skin stand as we uncover the story bit by bit. And this is the best you can come up with? $14.99 is too much money to spend on this utter filth and garbage. $14.99 is too much money to spend to be insulted by the developers, who think they can masquerade this bad cashgrab as a 'psychological horror game'. The only thing that is horrifying about this game is our ridiculously low expectations when it comes to paying for and hyping garbage like this on Steam. If you enjoyed 'Daylight', which is another horror game with procedurally generated levels, you might enjoy Hektor. They are both equally bad. Another option is to skip both games, and simply watch a let's play from one of the better youtubers out there. It will require a considerable amount of good acting skills on the part of the youtuber to beat some life into this dead dog's body.Otherwise, FASTER FASTER... avoid Hektor.

Procedurally generated post-apocalyptic worlds, need wood get wood, build block-based houses, form groups with other human players to survive, these are elements that are as overused as the faded tighty whities that I continue to wear to date. And who can forget the zombies.It's. Always. Another. Bloody. Ugly. Zombie.And that is why The Long Dark feels like a drop of pristine water on a wretched pair of lips. Its art-style is bold and deliciously refreshing in a game that is intended to simulate survival in the harsh conditions of the Northern Canadian Wilderness. Its rogue-like elements, such as permanent death and a finite amount of loot in the world, shifts the player's focus from spending hours upon hours developing a character and his or her humble abode, to spending hours upon hours replaying just to beat a previous personal best in terms of the number of in-game days survived. And instead of surviving against zombies, players in The Long Dark are tasked to survive against Mother Nature, which manifests in the form of biting windchills and harrowing blizzards, as well as the wolf denizens that perpetually roam the snowy terrains. The sound design of The Long Dark is also extremely well done. Everything from the crunch of your soles on snow, to the groaning and creaking of wooden floorboards as you scavenge a log cabin for much-needed supplies, to the resounding bellow of your hunting rifle as you fire it at a menacing wolf sounds engaging, immersive, and realistic.Yes, realism is The Long Dark's home address. Being caught outside while there is a windchill can be devastating, but hiding behind rocks sitting in the path of the direction of the wind can provide temporary relief to slow down the onset of freezing. The game's hunger system is also caloric based. Foods that you may loot from the environment have calories similar to their real-life counterparts (albeit scaled up slightly). Since all activities, including sleeping and standing still, burns calories, in order to survive your character has to consume a certain amount of calories each day. In addition, he or she also has to drink at least 2.2litres of water a day to prevent being dehydrated. On the other hand, innovation can be a two-faced \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. If taken too far, it can detract immensely from a game's production values and amount to a gigantic waste of a developer's time. Reinventing a tried-and-tested wheel, or removing core gameplay elements of a particular genre for no apparent logical or worthwhile purpose, are typical examples of taking innovation one step too far. As much as The Long Dark is a unique game that stands well apart from the rest in the survival genre, Hinterland Studio has adopted a couple of gameplay design choices that are difficult to comprehend, and for lack of a better word, paradoxical.The biggest culprit lies in The Long Dark's surprising lack of player interaction with the environment. Besides interacting with the game's various containers that exist in the form of drawers, lockers, cupboards, stoves, starting a fire, and the occasional shooting of a wolf or deer, there is little else that the player can do to change or manipulate the environment. Necessary activities such as the cooking of food, harvesting of meat from an animal's carcass, or the boiling of snow to make potable water, are reduced to dull and meaningless loading bars that signal the progression of an activity. There is no farming, there is no fortifying of a prefabricated house to better ward off the cold or wolves. I could think of a hundred more things that a player, as a survivor in an icy wilderness, would be expected to do to survive better. Sadly, players in The Long Dark are robbed of those options because the game limits the ways in which they can interact meaningfully with their environment. Why this should be so in a survival game is bewildering. It metamorphoses an otherwise open-world survival game, one that should be a suitable platform for the inception of personal survival stories, whether heroic or tragic, into a linear game of repetitive choices.This is not to say that The Long Dark is bereft of player-made choices. In spite of the game's limited player-environment interactivity, players still have a good amount of decisions to make that dictates how well or how long they will survive in The Long Dark. For example, constantly traveling in the open when there is a strong windchill will result in your character burning more calories as he or she freezes, thus requiring you to expend more of your limited food supply each day restoring those lost calories. Similarly, being greedy and attempting to carry all of the loot scavenged from your most recent exploration trip will also result in more calories burnt as your character shoulders the heavier load. Making a second trip on another day to carry the remaining supplies back to your stronghold may be a better strategy. Finding a way to make the most out of your limited supplies is an obsession that will occupy players, especially the compulsive ones, for many hours on end.Nonetheless, the negative effects on the game's longevity as a result of its decision to eschew player interactivity in favor of simplicity and ease of uptake are manifest. Despite The Long Dark currently sporting 3 different maps for players to explore in sandbox mode, the relative constrained size of each map and the finite number of prefabs for players to loot means that each map can support at most 4-5 hours of proper gameplay. Beyond that, the game starts to devolve into a tiresome cycle of hunting for deer or wolf, foraging for wood, cooking meat and boiling water to sustain your character's physical needs, and resting in bed. There is nothing else to do. You cannot build, you cannot farm, all there is left to do is to wait for the inevitable end. A most unfitting conclusion to a game with so much potential.At its current sale price of USD$19.99 on steam, The Long Dark is barely worth a buy. My suggestion is to wait for a sale before spending some of your hard-earned money on this game. The Long Dark will most certainly become a better game with time. On the other hand, you are also unlikely to regret if you choose to invest in this game now. It is one of the most polished and interesting early-access survival game that is currently available on the market. And if you enjoy a rogue-like survival game that challenges you to do better in each successive game that you initiate, The Long Dark is capable of providing an almost endless number of hours of enjoyment. I am therefore giving The Long Dark the thumbs up.""}, {""funny"": ""4 people found this review funny"", ""posted"": ""Posted January 30, 2015."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited March 2, 2015."", ""item_id"": ""251570"", ""helpful"": ""38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Survival isn\u2019t about immense power, gluttony, or the ability to safely forage, farm or store an infinite amount of food in your home. Survival is about a constant struggle to stay alive in a dangerous and uncertain environment, where the odds are most certainly stacked against you. And it is this essence which 7 Days to Die captures adequately and beautifully in the beginning, but which eventually diminishes and peters out due to the game\u2019s lack of late-game content.Starting out in 7 Days to Die is hard, very hard. The game is similar to Minecraft, it has no storyline or  tutorial to guide you on what to do next. Instead, you are simply thrown in the middle of the world in your underpants, no tools, only a can of chili, a bottle of water, a bandage, and a torch to your name, and tasked to survive.  Juggling your character's various needs, and managing your daylight time properly are both essential components of a viable survival strategy. And it's what makes 7 Days to Die so compelling and stimulating to play. Because frankly speaking, you never quite have enough at the start. And depending on your luck, that undesirable state may persist for a few more in-game days. The Fun Pimps have rightly, in my opinion, made some of tools that are important, but not strictly necessary to survival in the beginning, difficult to obtain. And herein lies 7 Days to Die\u2019s biggest problem. Because so much of its appeal is derived from putting its players in the seat of a survivor who never quite has enough to eat, drink, and is constantly struggling to stay alive against the odds which the game stacks heavily against them from the getgo, the lack of a forceful impetus to survive in the middle or later portion of a game, as one\u2019s character gains in strength and survivability, ultimately and ironically detracts from that appeal. This weakness speaks more to 7 Days to Die\u2019s apparent lack of late-game content than its heavy reliance on a relatively unsustainable premise such as survivability. At the moment, the game fully expects and encourages you to become stronger, but imposes no additional challenges to test your new-found strength. Zombies stay the same, develop no new capabilities, and although the game attempts to shake things up by throwing massive hordes of zombies at you every 7 in-game days or so, they are easily countered if you properly fortify your stronghold. I fully expect, and have faith, that The Fun Pimps will properly flesh out 7 Days to Die's content. At the moment, 7 Days to Die is still capable of offering its players many hours of deep and complex gameplay. I have only spent 50 hours playing it so far, and I believe I will continue to spend more time exploring, surviving and building in in 7 Days to Die. As an early access game, 7 Days to Die is definitely worth your money.""}, {""funny"": ""6 people found this review funny"", ""posted"": ""Posted January 8, 2015."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""233130"", ""helpful"": ""55 of 100 people (55%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""Started out strong: funny protagonist, the awesome recoiless submachine gun, big chunky enemies for you to pump your lead into, and last but not least, wang cookies.And then midway through the game, you will find that the game's initial charms start to wear off.

The cool weapons become underpowered as the game starts to pile more and more fatties at you at any single point in time. The level design is dreadfully uninspired and boring. You run from point to point triggering the game's setpieces in order to spawn the various over-used enemies which the game throws at you in every chapter. In between the points, you will almost never find any enemies lurking or patrolling. The katana is the game's saving point, severing limbs and decapitating heads never gets old. However, the hit boxes for the larger sized enemies are a little wonky, so you might find yourself supposedly slashing at the back of the bugger, only to be disappointed that none of the hits registered.

Aesthetically, the game is a pleaser. In terms of performance on the PC platform, save for the fps related issues on release week, Dying Light performs respectably even on a mediocre rig. On a high-end rig, Dying Light chugs along at the highest settings with nary a hiccup. As for its gameplay, the action in Dying Light is fast and fluid. Combat is flashy as well as impactful, and killing zombies has never felt more brutally satisfying. The parkour mechanic, which is your character\u2019s main form of locomotion in Dying Light, is also somewhat intuitive, save for a few logical inconsistencies. If your gut tells you that a bridge\u2019s truss is traversable to reach its top, you are unlikely to be wrong. Scaleable aspects of a building are very well-differentiated from those that you can\u2019t interact with. Thus whether it is crisscrossing Harran\u2019s rooftops, or climbing to the top of a clock tower to catch the setting sun, Dying Light\u2019s parkour mechanic makes it both hassle-free and a pleasure to explore its vast and interesting setting. There is no mistake about it, Techland has done an admirable job here: Dying Light is one hell of a game to play, whether alone or in a group. Unfortunately, Dying Light has about as much of a heart or soul as the cold and ruthless GRE boss that your character works for.  I could blame the game\u2019s lack of spirit on its poor storyline, as many other critics have done. I could also blame it on the half-arsed supporting characters that the game seemingly throws at you by the dozen, only to then either arbitrarily kill them off or to leave their relationship with your character hanging by a thread and incomplete. Rather I am going to attribute it to Techland\u2019s failure to make any of the interesting features, that it implements in a seemingly laundry-list like manner, into a mainstream component that properly defines Dying Light and what it stands for. Take the game\u2019s setting in Harran for example. Yes, Harran is a vast and spacious open-world in which players can explore to their hearts\u2019 content. Yes Harran is both beautiful, in a morbid kind of way, and immersive. Yet Techland barely utilizes it to further engage and immerse Dying Light\u2019s players. There is a wafer-thin amount of dynamic events in Harran, which usually exists in the form of survivors fending off zombies, or Rais\u2019 goons sitting idly on top of one of the air-supply crates which the game sporadically generates. Harran also remains the same dreary and worn out place that it was when your character first stumbled into it like the \u2018experienced\u2019 secret operative that he is, until the moment you dispose of your main nemesis and complete the game\u2019s main storyline. Converting one of its zone into a safehouse may result in you visually pushing or toppling a couple of shelves or cupboards over, as a form of barricading, but there is otherwise no obvious visual cues that suggest Harran is changing or evolving as a result of your character\u2019s actions. Neither does its inhabitants become better off as you fulfil the usually tedious tasks that they set you out to do. An extreme example is the game\u2019s escort missions, where completing one of them merely returns the relevant NPC that you successfully protected back to his or her starting spot, ready to offer you the same mission again. As a result, playing in Harran can occasionally provide a disconnected experience, one where you realize that nothing your character does ever truly matters. On the other hand, do I think that Dying Light is a game worthy of your money, even at full-price? Yes it is. The game is extremely well-polished and has a good amount of content for you to sink your teeth into. Parkouring your way through the game\u2019s numerous side missions is also an addictive experience. I can\u2019t count the number of occasions where I had originally set out to spend 15 minutes on one of the game\u2019s side mission, only to have those minutes turn into hours as I explore, craft, and decapitate or bash zombie heads in. It\u2019s most unfortunate that Dying Light\u2019s absence of a heart and soul, as a result of Techland\u2019s relative lack of ambition, means that it will remain a game that is a distance aways from being a truly great one. This in itself does not detract from the fact that Dying Light is through and through an entertaining game to play. And entertain you it most certainly will.""}]"

I went to EB games with $70 to spare. I was looking through the isle when this light caught my eye, it was a holy light, a light of which I'd never seen before. As I approached I could hear a choir of angels singing, filling my soul with righteous temptations. Temptations to mod, temptations to fight dragons and slay the evil of some far away place. When I touchd it I knew, I knew that this had been crafted by the gods themselves, that was the only explanation for this perfect creation. An angel came down, she told me her name was Aela, and that by purchasing this perfect creation I could see morre of her and be in the realm of the King of Gods himself. She guided me to the counter, her holy light forcing all the unholy corruptions away. When we aproached the counter, I reached in my pocket, and when I looked back the cashier had turned into a dragon! It had scales as dark as night, and red eyes that pierced straight into my soul, and it had Aela! It told me that since it could never see the light of Lord GabeN, it would never alow anyone else to. It took a deep breath, and I thought this was to be the end. But it was not to be, Aela threw me her sword, it's holy power guiding the hilt into my hands. I slashed at its neck,it screeched in agony. The beast lunged at me, but the holy power of the sword enhanced my reflexes and I managed to jump out of the way while taking a swipe at it's neck. The beast was furious now, it did not expect it's prey to fight back. I lunged at the beast, my holy sword easily piercing it's unholy hide. It howled in agony, for it new I had one this fight. As its unholy flesh burned, I looked to find Aela, but she was nowhere to be seen. In her place was a note that said\""Meet me in the land of Skyrim                                               -AelaP.S. nice beard\""I had no idea what she was talking about until I reached to my chin to find a beard. Not only that, but I had grown. Where as before I was a 5'3, I was now 6'4 with a majestic beard and ripling muscles.

Both modes handle very similarly, with Equipped mode allowing usage of talismans that you acquire by earning gold. I'll explain more about that in a moment. Anywhere from 2 to 4 Players take turns to cast spells (such as summoning Allies in the form of Elves, Dwarfs, Skeletons etc., or blasting foes away with Magic Bolt) and attack. In addition, everything is based of chance, so there are no health bars to keep track of (although I prefer health bars myself) e.g. it is entirely possible to have a dwarf defeat a dragon, even if the chance to succeed was only 9%. Some people will find this hard to handle.AestheticsChaos Reborn does a good job handling the graphics on all levels. Based of the Unity Engine does have some limitations, but everything has a nice consistent art style and the detail is consistent. One of my main gripes with my prior Robocraft review was that Robocraft's graphics worked against itself. With Chaos Reborn, I can't complain.SoundtrackI haven't listened to it much, but the sounds are as good as the graphics - consistent and making sense.CommunityIn the time it took for me to write this review, I had been waiting on a single League game to arrive - and yeah, I never actually got into a game. I would like for the developer to at least let us know how many people were on what gamemode, just so that people can find other people to play against. Unfortunately, outside of playing public matches and connecting to a central server, there literally is NO OTHER WAY to earn gold to buy new talismans and upgrade equipment. Apparently the upcoming Realms is going to introduce a better way of earning gold, but I am skeptical. Oh sure, you can play offline against others in a Hotseat match with bots, but you won't earn gold that way. Even if you could, you would have to still connect to the central server, so hmm.ConclusionGood game, but lacking good ways to keep me interested in playing online with others - especially when no others are on, which the game won't tell you about.Also, in the time I wrote this Review, I never got into a game of Chaos Reborn to earn said gold.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted December 10, 2014."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""301520"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""Don't get me wrong. Robocraft is a perfectly good game and all, but I do not recommend playing it. I will address why towards the end of the review. For now, let me address the critical aspects of Robocraft as a whole.GameplayThe Gameplay ranges from average to great - solely depending on how serious your teamates are about winning. The game consists of you and your team building whatever vehicles you want and setting about demolishing the other team. As of the date this review was made, you can have access to 5 different ways to blow the enemy sky high: SMGs, Plasma Cannons, Railguns, Tesla blades and a Nano-beamer which can restore allies vehicles. You can stack Tesla blades with other guns, but you can't have an SMG with a Railgun. The problem is that these are not very well balanced: Railguns are far worse than Plasma cannons, just as an example. Remember how I said that the battles can range up to great depending on your teammates? If you are using a railgun, you are literally dependant on your allies protecting you while it is recharging. And it takes a long time to do so, during which you are more vulnerable than a snowflake in a volcano, for lack of a better analogy. And since blowing up enemy vehicles is a part of the game, you can blow up individual parts of the enemy vehicles - in the time in takes for you to read this review up to here, you can now fire your railgun again, except you can't because someone has blown it up. Now you have to wait for someone else to come across and restore your guns so you can defend yourself. And now you are dead because your healing ally is busy polishing someone else's vehicle. And this happens more often than not. I should mention that the tier system in place for research (yes, research requires you to acquire Tech Points in varying tiers, and unless you pay real money, there is no way to cross-tier your Tech Points) is not that great - more than once have I seen Nano-beamers (which are acquired at Tier 7, minimum) used in a Tier 2 or 3 match, I have once had the pleasure of seeing an enemy using a Tier 10 Plasma in Tier 4 - Ouch is a massive understatement. At least now you have boss fights where a lot of T4s can fight a big, bulky, one-shotting T10. But this happens so rarely it might as well not have been implemented.There are items you can acquire to help you stealth your way around the map, such as Radar Jammers, but then the enemy can just spot you by pressing Q - which makes you very obvious to every enemy on the map - so there isn't a point. Also, only two parts of your vehicle - the pilot seat and the block it is sitting on - determine life or death.In order to acquire better stuff, you either pay endlessly (It takes at least $20 and a lot of grind to unlock everything in one sitting), you have to not only acquire Tech Points, but also Robo Points which are used for purchasing stuff once you have it available. Up until recently, dying yielded you a lot less points, even if you wiped out more than half the enemy team - the emphasis is on surviving rather than killing. Ironically, killing is the only way to acquire more points to pore into your vehicles. And that is pretty much all I need to say about the Gameplay.AestheticsThe Aesthetics are not exactly what I would call good, but it isn't terrible either. Robocraft is one of those games where you can literally build anything you want and it would be the way your vehicle is. Wait a minute, \""build anything you want\""? Isn't this somewhat vaguely familiar? As in overdone by this point? Not that this game does it poorly, but I think I have seen enough ugly vehicles, that are ugly on purpose, but I have seen some rather... rude... looking vehicles. There is very little moderation in terms of vehicle aesthetics. Otherwise, some of the maps are very good and are pleasing to look at, but then you build a flying vehicle and seen the endless plains outside the map. If it were me, I would have just used a skybox - they already implemented a force field to prevent you from leaving in a flying vehicle. At least a high-res Skybox would have been acceptable, and would yield less complaints, and would have been a lot more processor friendly. And that is all I have to say about Aesthetics - they are only graphics and are only responsible for maybe 20% of a game's value.SoundtrackThe soundtrack, even when the music volume is on full, can be rather quiet at times. I get it, it is supposed to create tension when I do rarely hear it, but if anything it annoyed me. Maybe that is because I prefer the soundtrack in any game to fit what the game is about - I do not associate the need for stealth with a game that is clearly about blowing the pilot seat out of a heavily armoured vehicle, and where stealth does little more than get you killed quicker if you try. I ended up turning off the music and listened to the Tyrian OST - which was much more suitable, but  I just happen to be listening to another game's OST while playing this one. So yeah, go figure.DeveloperI understand most people would not recommend a game because of its developers. This happened to Paranautical Activity, the developers said some rather nasty stuff to their fans and to Valve, and as a result they had their game kicked out. But the Developers for Robocraft are not like that at all. They regularly add new patches to their game to make it more fun - recently, a \""Hero Bonus\"" was added to compensate those people that die wiping out more than half the enemy team. And they make newspaper articles to hint at new features being developed. They also take some feedback on the odd occassion, albeit more of an acknowledgement than anything. For a team of 10 people, what they have achieved is pretty good so far. I encourage them to make a game that you have to pay money to play, as opposed to \""Pay to win\"", which is what Robocraft is rather sadly.Anti-Hacker PolicyOk people. I said that I don't reccommend this game and here is the reason. Now, I'm not a hacker, and as someone who will eventually get into game development, I fully understand the concerns that developers have for their games to ensure that people don't cheat to win. But there are far better ways of doing this than using EasyAntiCheat (also called EAC, Robocraft refers to its system as Roboshield). In case you don't know why anti-virus software has such a big problem with EAC, it is because EAC literally acts like spyware. When you play Robocraft, you are giving permission for the guys at EAC to monitor your personnal details. They can rename it however they like, it doesn't change what they are doing. Having access to your data is basically giving up your privacy for security, an area that is already being heavily debated in the Information Technology industry (remember the PAPA framework anyone? If you don't, I suggest you Google \""Mason, PAPA Framework\""). In anycase, they tell us that EAC is using the data being data-mined to detect hackers and such, but that is a lot of processing power being used, and I have trouble believing that it is all for 'verification' of the game's validicity. True, this is EASY Anti Cheat that FreeJam are using, but nothing is ever labelled as EASY unless there are ways around it. You may have noticed that less than 50% of Robocraft players are hanging around, and even that number is ever decreasing due to EAC. A far better and more person friendly approach would have been to use Valve's Anti Cheat (also called VAC). For one, VAC doesn't act like spyware, it is server side only (which is another advantage, you can't have your users decompile your EAC on their client to find exploits and whatnot) and uses less processing power which can free up more servers. And while yes, VAC is open-source, this is actually an advantage.And that is the review. DO NOT PLAY until they use VAC instead of EAC. Hopefully, they will correct that mistake soon.""}]"

I bought this game a few months back when it was $20 and it was worth it. It's a fairly challenging coop shooter with Zombies and it's a lot of fun. Plus it's 3 games in one, so for $8.99 it's a steal. This game features the stories from NZA 1 and 2 with updated textures, an exclusive third story continuing on from the other two that you can only buy in this collection, and a decent survival mode which is also exclusive to the trillogy. All are available in 4 player coop.It has a fairly healthy online community, but it's certainly best with friends, which is why I don't have much time on it. That said, it has a certain dark humour to its story which makes it both endearing, but also a bit terrifying at times. If you're a fan of Call of Duty Zombies, particularly World at War, you'll probably love this. I have a fairly mid range PC (AMD FX-6300, R9 270x) and I run this at 80 fps 1080p on high with supersampling off and it runs beautifully. The graphics are pretty decent too.If using an Xbox controller is your thing, the controller support is fantastic. Simply turn it on at any point and it'll work just fine. I use a 360 controller, but the game most certainly supports an Xbone controller too (it's image is used in the controls section of the options).Basically, buy it now while it's on sale because it's great.

The game is a joke, the balance is getting worse, the combat clunkier, the range combat is a waste of time. The devs could care less about finishing as they could about adding more DLC for kids to buy. How you can release DLC less than a month after an official launch and not give to preaccess and alpha is disgusting and should tell you all you need to know about these devs and what they think of the consumer.

It's good to have a challenge. However, there are too many other problems with the game that are just too big to ignore. Predominantely:- Graphics: While they are good, Codies have gone from looks over actual gameplay and functionality.- Multiplayer: is absolutely woeful. It's impossible to race against anyone effectively when the game can't keep up with who is where on the track. All of a sudden, you get told you're in first, and before you even cross the line, someone else has crossed it and pops up a fastest lap.- Push to Talk: Why was this stripped out of the game? I don't want to voice everyone in the game if I'm speaking to someone privately in a TS Server.- Glitches: ie: refer my posted screen shot - how the hell can a car drive around on rims!?!?!? This isn't the only one.- Gameplay assists: There's absolutely NO difference between Traction Control being off and on Medium. There was at least some difference on 2014.- Steam Achievements and Trading Cards: Despite doing at least 10 clean laps around Russia in a Marrusia in Time Trial, the game fails to recognise these laps towards the achievement - I don't know why. The game also claims to have Steam Trading cards - I'm yet to see any after nearly 4 hours of play, and a friend has 10 times as many hours (40) and hasn't seen any either. So the Trading Cards are a blatant lie at this stage.Codies - if you bothered to look at the Meta Scores in Steam for your games since 2010, they have been steadilly declining, with 2014 being the worst of the last 5. Your track record suggests that this one will be the worst of the lot. If you can't get your \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 together, you don't deserve a renewal to make more of these games from FOM.There's just one question remaining: Did anyone at Codemasters even bother to test this game PROPERLY before it was released?**EDIT: SInce my review, allegedly, trading cards have been released. **""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted January 11, 2014."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited January 11, 2014."", ""item_id"": ""267600"", ""helpful"": ""3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""Seriously, don't waste your money on this game - Go and source yourself a copy of the latest in the Airport Tycoon series, or Airline Tycoon Evolution.

Honestly, after the first hour, it was a sad reaity that all one would do the for majority of the time was sit and stare at a screen and click a few buttons every few minutes.This game should be rated \""P\"" for PATHETIC. It feels drastically un-finished, the game physics are poor (and have been demonstrated by numerous others who have played this game).

I'd recommend anyone who hasn't to at least take a brief look at the characters origins.For the game proper, it's an interesting mix of open world mayhem with a lot of destruction and some crazy superpowers. Although the story starts well, the tedious and long introduction to the world gets a bit annoying, but as the game progresses the missions get even weirder and pretty funny. Fight a giant soft drink mascot with a national monument!As I said though, the context of the missions is very bizzare and often will make absolutely no sense if you haven't played or at least read up on the previous games.

And it seems that particularly in Fallout: New Vegas people really see people like Mr. House as these real entities and not just figments of our imagination.\u201d-Co-founder of Obsidian & author of the Fallout Bible Chris Avellone:  \u201cQuest and exploration freedom that, at the least, can be accomplished by a stealthy, combat, and \u201ctalky\u201d character.

Now, onto the review. The first thing I say is - it is DEFINITELY an improvement over Rome II, not doubt in my mind. The two differ; In Rome II, it is about building your chosen nation to glory, whereas in Attila it is mainly about maintaining your empire in one of the most turbulent time periods in Europe's history.On the topic of Attila himself. I have one tip - always try to destroy The Huns before Attila becomes ruler. Attila is born beginning of 400AD, and the game starts at 395AD and has 4 turns per year. If I'm correct you have 20 turns until Attila is born.When he becomes ruler, boy, you are in trouble. He constantly spawns stacks that harrass the player, especially if the player chooses a Roman Faction. He is truly the Scourge of God.The Western Roman Empire (or the WRE, referred from now on) is in a state of military and economic decline under Flavius Honorius Augustus. The empire is being attacked from all corners and civil unrest is everywhere. The WRE is severly overextended, and from turn one, nations declare war on them and destroy them.I found the WRE didn't really succumb to the barbarian invasion, instead break-away nations such as Britain, Africa, Gaul or Hispania took over parts of the Empire. These nations are have the Roman culture, so Roman buildings, units and leaders. Overall I didn't feel like the WRE fell to barbarians, but to its rebels.Onto the features I like:Cities are unique; Londinium, Roma, Constantinople and Ctesiphon are just a few. You can now bust through the walls of the impenetrable Theodosian Walls and set fire to the Hagia Sophia (Even though the Hagia Sophia wasn't built until circa 500AD, under the reign of Justinian.) Improved combat.Family trees.Horde mechanics.Dat Rome I menu like doe. Ect.Now the negatives:Diplomacy mechanics are identical to Rome II.Faction panel still confusing.Sassanids and Huns (when Attila is ruler) are op.NO ATHENS! If you feel like you want a big faction that is easy, play the Sassanid Empire, not the Eastern Roman Empire! I made that mistake myself, and a couple of turns later the Visigoths took Constantinople and destroyed all of Greece.TL;DR - The game has improved on Rome II, with cool new features. It, however, still has its flaws. Overall I would recommend this game.SCORE - 85/100Update - I have no idea why Steam""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted March 14."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""271590"", ""helpful"": ""4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""Before I go right into my rant I LOVE the single player to pieces.

Maybe not EVERYONE likes this game but, the amount of DETAIL put into this game is just, amazing.The game is about running a prison, and it sticks by it, your prison is in your hands, BUT, my favorite part, is that it's not FULLY in your control. Sure you can assign patrols and use non lethal, but VERY effective tools to placify an inmate. But even with that, you will always get TERRIFIED if one prisoner starts rioting, and they take out a weapon, the guards can fight them, but they attack OTHER inmates, then its the matter of getting a guard ASAP to the area, or risk a life or 2, and recently, when the ability to FAIL was added, suddenly you couldn't let the inmates escape or let a riot go on for too long, which made it MORE intense when a riot broke out.The developers themselves are probably the most best ive ever seen, they never get off track with other ideas, as explained in one of their videos, but, they take ideas from all the players, and get the community and, are now working to wipe most of the bugs out of the gameAs mentioned before, not every person may like this game, partly because of the amount of patience needed, but, i dont care, in my opinion, also, the freedom of the modding community is perfectThis game, takes the idea of running a prison, and strategy, and mashes it up into one game, would i reccomend it, OF COURSE, i have put hours, not only building my OWN prison, but downloading others, huge riots, fires, and a prison built for 16 must quickly be adjusted for 45!You dont have to, but to sum all of this up in 3 words, they would be: BUY THIS GAME""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted July 6."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""252250"", ""helpful"": ""6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""As long as the devs keep updating it frequently, you can't really not reccomend the game, though I do have an issue, here's how my most recent run went.>Get space heaters and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, charge, etc>Nobody is making food.exe>why the...>Plants not growing, light and space heater present>This didn't happen before>People run out of food before they run out of water>Check food maker-thing, nobody is using it>40% of the colonist population dies from starvation instantly>ragequit.exe>logic could not be foundThough the game has really stunning graphics, and is extremely fun.So long as it works.

By the end of the game you'll be kicking yourself reflecting on what you just played through. There's nothing like a game that actually makes you contemplate the meaning of the message that's being sent across, and Spec Ops delivers it perfectly. Graphics are great especially the environment, with the graphics of the people being acceptable. The buildings are also quite interactable, with them sometimes being a must for a strategical maneuver in key events within the story.Varieties of guns are plentiful with all being effective in killing your enemies. These include pistols, shotguns, snipers, auto rifles, grenade launchers and rocket launchers. It's the realism that impressed me with just how fast ammo runs out; making you scatter around for other guns and spare ammunition. There's also added features to guns such as lasersights, grenade launcher toggle, burst fire and silencer, which in the right situation can get you by without a scratch. Sound is excellent with the voice acting, gun shots and music being of high quality. I never had a problem with any sounds whatsoever and the music was fitting to the scene.You can manage your squad, allowing them to flashbang or prioritize key targets. This can be done with your 2 squadmembers specialising in sniper skills, and also grenades. However, your squad are not invincible and if enough damage is taken, they will fall and you will either need to revive them yourself or order the other squadmember to do so (there is a timer until death). You on the other hand will die quickly by taking too many bullets (there's even people trying to stab you) which forces you to take cover often and makes cover a pivotal part of your survival. There is no healthbar but the screen starts to turn grey.Sometimes, you the player are prompted to make hard decisions, and some are set with a timer as well. Even the small ones that paint you as a person of mercy or a person of cruelty are really great.The controls can be a little bit tough to get used to, with some functions being combined onto one key such as a single key binding being both sprint and take cover. The only real problem I have with the game is the bug in which you can't really change your mouse sensitivity within the game itself, and I had to resort to decrypting the game files in order to change to a more preferred sensitivity. Other than that, this game really blew my mind and lessons are learnt through morality. I would recommend for anyone who hasn't played the game yet, for it is truly a memorable experience.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted October 26, 2015."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""50130"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Absolutely amazing atmosphere and graphics coupled with the indulging story and voice acting creates this masterpiece of a game.

Although GTA Online mode is enjoyable, it's only enjoyable if you're playing with a group of mates. If you play alone, be prepared to get randomly attacked out of the blue where you're up against players who are ranked 10x higher than you, which leaves the online environment unbalanced and not wanting to paticipate much. Other than that, great game and many things to do while free roaming.""}]"

No main-storyline, no ending. Puzzles were way too easy. Cases are predictable. This game honestly took a huge step back from The Testament in terms of storyline, but a huge leap forward in gameplay.Great visuals, Baker Street/Whitechapel has greatly improved over The Testament. Voice acting is well done (accents), but lip-syncing is pretty disappointing for next-gen gaming. Very unique game mechanics with new interesting concepts like Imagination and Sherlock Talent. The only downside to these is that the game tells you directly where your targets are, which just kills the fun. It'd be better if the Sherlock Talent just gave the game a filter or texture that makes it easier to see objects of interest, rather than make them glow.6 in-depth very intriguing, however, very predictable cases. It's a great improvement over The Testament, which was more like an interactive movie. This game allows you to not only make your own deductions, but make your own conclusions, choose your own guilty party and make your own moral choices as to how you will covict them. No main storyline (except for  The Merry Men terrorist group  ), which is HUGELY disappointing, especially in a Sherlock adaptation.

The loading times and setup however is pretty \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665-poor. I've spent 16 hours in-game, most of which are probably spent joining servers and loading up the game. The graphics/animations were nice. Original textures and decal, detailed landscapes and maps. Animations are mostly consistent. It has a unique fighting engine, having an anatomical damage-system instead of the normal health based system, like the Overflow indie engine. The physics are a bit off, seeing a lot of bugs and glitches here and there but that's okay for a game still in it's beta stage. Controls were fairly simple, hard to pickup but very satisfying when I got the hand of it. The community at times can be painful to put up with, witnessed first hand on many accounts people taking over servers and changing the game-modes (Free-duels to FFA). Full of obnoxious kids ignoring game rules, leaves me exiting the game frustrated every time. I only bother with higher level servers, although I don't fit that criteria, is the only games that have players who give two \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about the quality of gameplay. I'm sure there will be a more in depth story-line to come in the future, but for now it's not fair to hold the game against it.""}]"

The only thing that keeps me playing is I spent money on it early, only to find how shallow it is. They tend to nickel and dime, watch out for the packs they do not sell what they imply, items that are sold as account upgrades end up being tied to one character only, inventory space is especially problematic and being an Patron is pretty worthless. Keep your expenditure to a minimum to save disapointment.Added to this are some really lame quests, rather than them making tricky or stealthy or skilled, just enemies you need to shoot a bajillion times, it gets boring pulling the trigger again and again and again on your nerf gun ......Want a better weapon, no problem the very worst legendary weapon system ever, ties the the most ludicrous levelling system level 100 nope try 5000, this as a scam because you leave your best legendary weapons behind or spend real money trying to keep them up with your level and you will not do it with spending cash when it comes to legendary weapons.TRION pretty much suck as a F2P publisher being way to nickle and dimey, driving players away from the game, needing more revenue, become more nickel and dimey, drive more players away, need more revenue become more nickle and dimey etc.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted May 20, 2015."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited April 28."", ""item_id"": ""236390"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""Reasonable graphics, not bad gameplay, but problems with matchmaking.Can not comment on what it is like to play when you spend big but that has always seemed pretty whacked to me, like paying to cheat as game feature.Match loadings are much quicker now, the catch the more you play for free, the slower they become, much slower and not for the reason you think but because they are stacking you against a team where more and more players will be 1 or 2 tiers higher than you ie you become a target drone, against planes with better armament and better speed and sometimes better maneurverability.Problem with these games having only a PvP format means they can not set up more interesting missions, where NPC take on particular roles.

Poor visual and game mechanic sync, where certain enemies like thugs reach far more than appearances would indicate and if the visual matched the game mechanic their arms would be dragging along the ground a couple of feet behind them.The idea of extremely weak weapon that wear out at a ridiculous rate and require constant repairs is also pretty annoying, an accepted idea taken way to far.Overall the game comes off as having a rather juvenile sense of humour, making the game more annoying than fun, more of a frustrating struggle than a challenge. A game that you could take years to finish, as you just stop playing rather than putting up with the annoyances and then come back to it months later to continue from the last save before again putting it away prior to finishing it.It's a shame Steam don't offer game refund credits, so you can spend unload games like this and spend it on alternate titles, this game is definitely of money back quality.""}]"

So far (14.6h) I've been playing as Humans (with my own custom civ traits of course - they make a MAJOR difference in your gameplay experience) on Normal difficulty, huge system with 9 other civs, and I'm currently faced with enemies on both my northern and southern space borders. I'm also becoming quite chummy with some samurai space bears. Now I've seen some complaints about Stardrive 2, and I have to admit my first few hours had a couple of complaints - mainly research and... well, I'll tell you what else when I get to it. Further into the game I found out how they downgraded the spy system, but let's get back to research. I was annoyed at how you could not research all the tech on the same tier, and then I encountered my first race. (I'd like to mention that I don't go exploring the entire galaxy, so I don't encounter multiple races before I'm ready to deal with them. That'd just be STUPID... Hmm was that too rude of me?) When I entered diplomacy with them, I was happily surprised to find out that you could trade the tech they had researched for whatever you feel like giving them. After encountering a few more civs, and by the time I met up with my favorite bear shogunate, I realized that unless you take diplomatic action towards these aliens, they're gonna wonder why they should keep the stupid foriegners around rather than kill and conquer them.I should probably mention that being able to customize your ships relatively freely is a big plus for me. They made it a touch simpler than the original StarDrive, but while it was disappointing at first - I realized it cut down the time I spent designing my failures and designing new ships to replace the failures (since they sucked in combat) or redesigning my redundant ships (due to new tech). For example, in SD1 you could face all your weapon firing arcs forward. In SD2, the location of your weapon decides where it aims (except cannons/mass drivers - they always aim forward) The way around this though is to select the *arc extend* feature on the turrets you mount so they cover a 180* angle - aka they can fire forward. I'll be updating this review in a few days once I'm back home and play a bit more, so I'll leave you with this: if you like customization and you find that you can understand a game's mechanics fairly quickly, then you'll enjoy this game.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted January 28, 2015."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""346010"", ""helpful"": ""3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""As much as I've enjoyed Besieging, I can't wait for the level editor; I want to be unsiegable.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted July 22, 2015."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""368160"", ""helpful"": ""0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""[Just a comment - not a review] Loved it!

The bugs were limited to; already said lines being repeated without reason in the middle of a conversation - some lines being said by the wrong character - a single case of a repeat of the previous line instead of the correct line.

GG WM (Well Made). 5/5^ and that is the tl;dr of my review.Combat (Captain Mode) 5/5Captain mode is the Normal mode for this game. Out of 2 playthroughs (twice thru the 1st arc, and once thru the second arc), I can say I had no great issues. The last fight in the 1st arc was a fun challenge. Gameplay changes quite a lot depending on your unit investments (you spend cash earnt from scrapping enemies on weapon damage, accuracy, energy usage, HP, EP, and more). I usually set up my ship to fire two rounds of kinetics per turn. In the second arc, there are two battles which will feel impossible (and will be if you don't have the support units for it). The 1st difficult fight (in the second arc) is one of the three side missions. Do the other two first to rack in the cash. Then you can beat this side mission with enough game knowledge. The second hard mission, is just that there are TOO MANY ENEMIES! I mean seriously, TOO MANY ENEMIES JUST TO AMBUSH ONE CARGO SHIP! I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THAT BLOODY SHIP! Honestly though, the combat is fun. There are also 6 difficulty options that you can change in game, so if you get stuck on a mission, you have an easy way out. Or if it's to easy for the master tactician, then you can go be a flippin' space whale.Characters - 4.5/5Potential Waifus are all great. If you aren't happy with any of them, ask for a refun- Oh wait, it's free. Free Waifu is good Waifu.Seriously though, from justice loving, to perverted, to tsundere, to childhood friend, to shy, to patriot, and all the way to \""I only live to fight\""; You have a large variety of waifu candidates.Story - 4.5/5*Prologue Spoilers*You're a Captain who's just minding your own business, testing out a prototype ship (welcome to Mass Effect, the VN. Comes with extra waifus), when the USSR invades. Nah, just kidding. It's just a lot of angry people being told that they should be angry at everything, and to vent that anger by shooting space lasers and rail guns at everything that isn't them. So, after a massive capital ship called Legion singlehandedly rips apart your local fleet, it then nukes your capital city. Obviously, you can either die fighting or live to fight another day, so you run for your mfern life. Then you gather allies (waifus) from all over the galaxy to smash the angry peasants that nuked your home. The story is enjoyable though. I enjoyed it.Style - 5/5Style? You have a kick-\u2665\u2665\u2665 ship, space lasers, space whales? Huh? Anyway, you have your own robot-piloting, waifu army. These bad girls have lasers, rockets, rail guns, swords and sidearms. They also disable capital ships, snipe rocket frigates, and download enemy porn collections? Urgh, that stupid pervert. What I'm trying to say is that this game is great.Since it's 100% free, get this awesome game.""}]"

That is definitely a true statement. If you want a complex strategy game with diplomacy and something new around every corner, this is not the game for you. The missions are thoroughly repetitive and if you like that style of gameplay, everything so far has felt like a long slow grind getting from one side of the map to the other. However, beating up pirates and trying to figure out how to win a naval battle against three pirates who are bigger and more badass than you is super fun and I have died a solid six or seven times in three hours of gameplay trying to take on an area or battle that was too much for me. I'd recommend playing co-op as it's a lot more fun to raid and plunder and fight for supremacy with a friend on the map - though character players feel OPd (if only because PCs can manoeuvre better), even in areas that i would think are meant to be a lot harder for you. All in all i'd give this game a solid 7/10.Pros:Naval battlesPiratesBlowing stuff upDoesn't require a ridiculous amount of thinkingCo-opCons:RepetitiveI cannot see the appeal in playing a diplomatic or trade based game (though I may change my mind when I need a lot more money)Graphics are eh""}]"

Feeling guilty and at a  total loss, I decide to reload my save and try the boss again. This time I figure out how to defeat it without killing it. I feel much better about the outcome this time around and my guilt is relieved... that is... until I go to the next room and talk to the flower again. My jaw dropped, my guilt returned. This game is far less forgiving that I would have ever imagined. At that moment, I suddenly started to realize why this game got such high praise. (I am not going to spoil what the flower says. Try the game and replicate what I just described and then you will really begin to understand how deep this game is).Best 10$ I have ever spent. Oh, and take it from me, for the love of all that is good, make sure that you eventually see a secret area called the 'True Lab' (Not to be confused with the regular lab you will see during every playthrough).

While a great game Dark Souls 2 lacks something which the previous game (Dark Souls 1) had. Firstly the soundtrack in DS2 is not as good the one amazing pieces in DS1. The Firelink Shrine theme brings out so much nostalgia and is so memoriable which DS2 lacks among it's musical pieces. The boss fights in DS2 are amazing and difficult however the repetitive \""Knight\"" or \""Swordsman\"" Bosses can get a bit annoying. One reason I probably found these fights to be easier in DS2 is probably because I played on launch day and could summon people which in DS1 I mainly played alone. I do not think that the Bosses in DS2 are easier however because there are more of them it can seem repetitive (Still very fun though). I cannot comment much on the pvp because again I played DS1 quite late on my xbox 360 and was not invaded very often. I can however say that the summoning system is a lot better and that there is a lot less lag. The only problem is soul memory which I hope will be patched soon. The actual gameplay is not as tight as the gameplay in DS1 however it is a godsend for players whom experienced a lot of lag in DS1 that the ease of backstabbing has been fixed. Also the guard break is a welcome feature due to the annoyance of turtling in the previous game. However, another problem is the innefectiveness of poise in this game which means I can guardbreak a full havel's no problem. This hopefully will also be fixed. Due to this being my first review it is more of a ramble, however I strongle recommend this game. Even though I have mostly listed it's faults, the game is still difficult and it is easy to put in 200 hours of time into it.

Also the game itself honestly is not good enough to be compared to other games of its genre specifically in ways of visual appeal/graphics, after all isn't space meant to be a \""beautiful enigma\""?.. e.g Star Conflict is free to play (although some things must be payed for) however the controls and visuals are far superior than SSZ and for me (Star Conflict) \""destroys\"" SSZ in the field of which SSZ professes to be the best at: Combat.. Strike Suit Zero has a good story and can be entertaining at points however those are the only positives I can state about this game.. If you are to get this game.. get it on sale..

If you enjoy First person sandbox survival RPG's with a strong crafting base, then please read this review.Pro's and Con'sFirst Person Sandbox Survival RPG- A rewarding leveling system, where your choices influence your ability to construct a variety of building, affecting in turn what you can craft.- Mount and Blade type of atmosphere with animals, survival and settlement building thrown in.- Procedurally generated world, will the slaughter of bears never end  ?! mwahahahar...- The world regenerates, trees will grow over time, ores will reappear somewhere and animals respawn- A tad buggy.. some Animals will be invincible ( FLEE, run for your life, ... this bear isn't taking any damage ) but when you find a Wildberry bush that has an enormous amount of fruit to give you won't complain hahahah nomnomnom..- Some perks are ineffective, or rather do not give you the listed bonuses, such as Yager and Skinner.- So i've built a Settlement... but im rather alone.. /tumbleweeds... how do we attract people to our Settlement ? good question :P This is why I suggest starting at another Settlement and expand with them for now.- Framerate issues / Lag.  It's an issue for quite a lot of folks.  I will suggest you Choose \""Fastest\"" for Video / Graphics options when you run the game.  Try removing the Bloom setting in game as well.Firstly.. choosing your beginning perks with the 20 points you get.. well, much can be said here, but i'll try to spare you some time.  I understand a lot of people will do w/e they like and discover what works for them. I've started several times myself in order to either dump a corrupt save and start again or retry new perks from the beginning. The faster you get exp the better imho ( in my honest opinion )I recommend starting with Chopper, Scholar & Scrivenr ( giving you a 25% exp bonus )You will start at a random point on the map with an Axe, a sword and a torch. Allow me to give you some advice on where to go from here..  Look around and find a tree that is NOT near a bear hahahah... no seriously.. you need to make a bow and arrows..TAB opens your inventory and the one the left hand side you'll find tabs, the topmost tab is your inventory, pickup and place the axe in your left-most hand slot to equip it, close inventory with TAB again and press 2 to weild the Axe.  Walk over to the tree or Hold Left Shift while you move ( W,A,S,D ) towards it to run.  When you reach the tree a circle will appear for your aiming reticle signalling that you are in range to begin harvesting it.  Chop Chop Chop.. ( hold left mouse ) you'll notice the circle filling slowly... when it fills you will receive 1 Wood ( 2 x wood and chopping speed if you chose the Chopper perk ).When you've fulfilled your lumberjacking fantasies enough ( 6 wood is a good enough start ) you open your inventory again and pick the tab at the bottom for crafting, choose to craft on the right hand page without a bench and you turn wood into planks 1 wood = 5 planks = 1 self crafted wooden bow,  1 plank = 1 arrow etc, leave the arrows in your inventory while you are crafting more arrows and they will continue to stack to 20.Place your new bow in the left slot and the arrows in the right slot and you are ready to hunt bears ( cackles maniacally )Lets face it.. in this game there's no point hunting anything but the creature that gives you the most EXP.  Bears will give you 200 exp without any of the Scholar tree perks.  Press 2 to wield the bow, click ( or hold ) the RMB ( right mouse button ) to prepare the bow for firing in your other hand and hold RMB to arm an arrow and raise the bow. Now at this stage you can either click LMB to fire or unhold RMB to lower the bow thereby not wasting the arrow.  Alternatively you can use LMB holding down to ready the bow and release to fire the arrow, but you cannot lower the bow from this stance and save the arrow.Find a Settlement asap ( M to open map.. if it looks like a Chapel ( not a greek Pantheon ) run to it,  the faster you get there the sooner you can begin to take quests from the board, earning you gold and exp. I have personally not experienced any reputation / Fame increments from completing quests for the population, but i've been more of a wanderer around the map, searching for a perfect place to build my own settlement.Now you're ready to explore.. make a name for yourself in this world of infinite bears... will you become Master of the hunt, roaming the land and setting up rudimentary shelters to rest before you again set off to explore.. Or will you become Jack of all Trades, buying from towns, crafting their produce into something better to resell again elsewhere. Or an owner-builder taking a piece of land for yourself and establishing a Settlement, building it the way you see fit. ?Either way this game is certainly a great way to spend your days, immersed in the survival, crafting and hunting. Pick it up and see for yourselfIn this Early Access state I give it a 6 / 10.  The more content and patches it receives, the better.

For the record I'm playing in the Oceanic region, so if you're not from there these issues may not apply to you. Positives:-interesting take on multiplayer-diverse character roster with different traits and skills-reasonably priced (not a $100 dollars for a multiplayer only experience *cough* Titanfall *cough*)-fair progression system (big surprise coming from Ubisoft instead of being locked behind a micro-transaction)-solid gunplay and action-strong focus on teamwork (choose not to respect this, and prepare to get your \u2665\u2665\u2665 kicked)-decent variety in scenarios and maps which cleverly blends the two aspects-genuine tense moments Negatives (brace yourselves this may get lengthy):-clunky matchmaking (this is a BIG negative as it tends to favour hosts with high latency. More often than not I join players with 300 ping minimum, making teamwork at times impossible and being shot by laggy enemies)-frequent disconnections and slow wait times (as far as I can tell it seems it uses peer-to-peer matchmaking, reminiscent to the Call of Duty multiplayer on consoles. I found this especially bad in terrorist hunt, as we have 4/5 players in the lobby, I check my watch and on average I have to wait 2 minutes to find one more player! And it's ALWAYS one more player! Worse yet we can't start the match until we have a full roster, even then good luck because chances are you have 300 ping minimum. To rub more salt in the wound, when I leave the lobby I have to wait on average 15 seconds to reach the god damn main menu most of the time)-lazy tutorials (a bunch of short videos that show aspects of gameplay, but I had to dive into the options menu to figure out some of the damn key bindings. I figured the situations mode was a more in-depth tutorial mode, but 9/10 times I get absolutely destroyed with only a brief intoduction video to show me what the hell I am meant to be doing)-tedious UI (I have to actually be in the operator selection screen to be able to check my ping, before realising I'm bloody connected to a host in the northern hemisphere. Then guess what? I leave to find another host and I'm forced into more loading times----which just adds up, and up into blood boiling rage. At this rate a random dice roll would be better than this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 of a system)-odd bugs that cost you the outcome of a match (inconsistent kill cams really stood out to me, as one of my team mates shot the last enemy standing escorting the hostage, yet somehow we lost the game. Mind you we saw the kill cam where the enemy died and the hostage was perfectly fine. Another one I experienced was the whole teams audio dropped out, there was muzzle flash but we couldn't tell where the enemy was as sound plays a vital role in this game. My whole team died and in a cruel twist of fate, the sound recovered afterwards)Conclusion: I really did have fun with this game----WHEN I had a stable connection. As I said before, these issues seem to be mainly a regional problem. I feel like I'm spoilt for choice as with TF2 and CS:GO, in a click or two I'm already in a solid and stable game in little time, thanks to my server browser preferences. The game mechanics and scenarios are awesome, but in its current state I cannot recommend this. Ubisoft really needs to over-haul the matchmaking system, if it wants to maintain interest in the multiplayer market long term. I don't want to feel like I'm playing a multiplayer game on a console since finding a game is inconsitent and clunky, which makes it feel dated real fast. It makes me think that the system was in fact optimised for the consoles, which is a bad sign in itself.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted March 17, 2014."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""204100"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""First time I had several problems with random crashing and blue screen.

Characters never seem to have enough \""Oomph' in their attacks, as if they can barely hold up the weapon itself. The headshot mechanic is finicky and also not responsive (I may be wrong, but I found whenever I landed a decent hit to an opponent it would do damage, but not nearly as much as when you are poked in the face from a reeling attack from the opponent and are instantly defeated from it.)10/10 most unresponsive and difficult control scheme imaginable.Camera needs to be fixed, constantly becomes stuck on walls. Limited zoom option. I found myself hindered in combat as I constantly needed to reset the camera view whenever my character went too close to a wall.

Conversations are happening very slowly and you only have 2 options, 1 Evil and 1 Good, also walking around pleasing the Citizens by greeting hundreds of people and doing small walk quests several times gets very tiresome and takes a huge amount of time.I must admit the start of the game gives a good impression and its fun to unlock the main chests on the spirit road and see weapon upgrades, but that is quickly done and the variety of weapons are very slim, also they even almost all look alike.The game overall if you dont complete all the pointless things, wont take too long to complete and the Story Mode feels fairly short and not really that exciting either.Im very sad about it, but i have to say No to Fable 3, i simply cant recommend this, im a huge fan of Fable, but i give reviews after my own thoughts, opinion and experience through out the game and this story simply wasnt enjoyable at all and the gameplay lacked just as much, very doll and boring.""}]"

H&G seemed a promising game, during the first few updates. However, the update that revamped the leveling system killed the game for me. This update completely reworked the amount point required for each rank and also poorly scaled the amount earned in battle. It seemed the game wanted me to be heavily reliant on its 'Pay2Win' system which involved spending lots to gain little progress.Though I disapprove of its scheme to make money, I like how the idea for WWII fps has been conveyed through this game. I still recommend this game as it is still only early access and the many flaws it still has can be ironed out, as there is still time until Reto-Moto finally release it. To the digression of those willing to download, be wary of the game's performance, I run decent specs and it is still laggy as hell. Also keep track of server maintenance as it can get annoying.10/10 - IGN, \""Would flip a tank again.\""""}]"

To list this out.Pro\u2019sDeep rewarding crafting System.levelling system.Massive open world full of horrors and thing's that want you for food.Fun tribe system with friends.Solo offline mode allowing you to learn and get the hang of the game before online.Dev's actually seem to care and have updated the game and fixed bugs all thoughtout day one.Con'sRequires graphics tweaking even for higher cards.Some small physics bugs e.g. body's flying and being tossed away abit.Mostly the biggest con for people is it requires a beast of a machine and even then you need to tweak the graphics.But after all that I\u2019ll keep playing it, because I so far find this the most enjoyable Survival game out.Computer Spec'sProcessor.Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz Graphics Card.NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 Ram.Kingston HyperX Beast 16.0 GB OS.Microsoft Windows 8.1, 64-bit Upgrading my GTX760 soon to a new GTX970 (about 2ish weeks away)Will update my review when It's installed & I've played it.I wish there was more than Yes/No for review Early Access games, but so far if you can tweak the graphics right I recommend this over other early access survival games.Thanks for reading.Deatheffekt.Update #1 Patch 171.511 Hours mostly all in game I doubt even an hour is in the menu/server list, and I honestly say if you can get this running get it, I've loved every second of it.The updates since day one have been great, the game runs way better for me atleast and looks amazing, the hard work the dev's are doing will pay off, and I honestly see this being finished one day if they keep doing this.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted July 7, 2014."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""35140"", ""helpful"": ""1 of 1 people (100%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""What can I say about Arkham Asylum, I already own it for PS3 and Bought it on while it was on sale, I love every moment of this game.  10/10""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted June 25, 2015."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited June 25, 2015."", ""item_id"": ""208650"", ""helpful"": ""1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Now I have Arkham Knight on PC & PS4.Played about 5 hours on the PC running on a I7-4770, GTX970 with 16gb's of ram, and swapped to the playstation 4 copy when I got that which I've played longer.I've always felt the Arkham series was desgined and better on consoles given the last 2 games PC launches (City/Knight).I love this series, and will be sad to finish this amazing game.

I'd say it is aimed at a specific audience for a start. Some may find the gameplay potentially mind-numbing due to the whole repetitiveness with no action, but personally I find it's not too bad to play, because in some points you can also hire workers if you find it too stretching. It is better with friends (as are most games) as it creates more of a mood as well as splitting up the work between you.Essentially: Start with a little bit of money and some vehicles. Plant stuff, harvest, sell, repeat and get more income so that you're able to upgrade your vehicles, equipment and buy more land to maximise your profit. Pretty much an endless cycle until you have the best equipment and vehicles.The graphics aren't particularly good, but if you're someone that isn't bothered by that - You'll be right.The physics are pretty weird, but that's fine because they're pretty funny to play with. The game can also be customised to a certain degree with a large variety of community maps and vehicles that can be downloaded in.Once again, I say that this game is surely not for everyone, but it's not bad if you don't mind the straight forward farming concept with partial monetary and banking section involved. In final, I'd say pick this up on a sale if you like the look of it. What you see from gameplay and trailers are essentially what you get.

The default keybindings I found pretty terrible to be honest, and the game using Xbox controller key prompts made it all the more frustrating. After having played with a controller and changing the keys to my liking though, I have to say that I couldn't bring myself to go back to the controller.Dark Souls II has fairly decent graphics, but falls short of triple A releases. It makes up for that with a smooth 60 frames per second which is absolutely vital in a game like this which requires you to patiently learn enemies moves while dodging death by the breadth of a hair. Fortunately you don't need a beast of a PC to run it either, with my average (or below) set up of an AMD Radeon HD 6780 + four gigs of RAM I experienced maybe three or four frame drops through my ten characters.The game itself is really quite challenging. Casual gamers I'd imagine would have a hell of a time trying to adapt and I'd highly reccommend searching for the hidden attributes in some stats and what they fully affect, while Hardcore gamers will have plenty of room to trip up as well. Don't fret if the game feels too intimidating, failing is a large part of every Souls players first experience, it's the ecstacy in beating the jerk after your tenth try for some sweet revenge and coming back later in the game when you're more experienced to take the time to torture them.As far as Online Play goes... You'll find a lot of fantastic people willing to engage in jolly cooperation, but keep in mind that there are no rules in the Dark Souls universe, in a broken and decaying Kingdom it's every man for themselves and some people just want to watch the world burn.""}]"

Ok yes it's a bit of a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 move to ask your customers to pay for an addon when the game is still in Early Access but i'm going to be honest. I Paid $30 for a moderate game that was just starting out. It was interesting but was unable to hold my attention for a long period of time. I took a brake from it. Came back to it last week. There is a huge amount of changes, new dinos, new objects new biomes etc. Theres moving bases now, either via raft or via platform on the back of a dino. This is a huge upgrade to when i initially played ARK. People are complaining about a new DLC, i can't say im happy about paying for the new DLC but, so far i haven't. I may come to buy it in time, but there is more content, unique effects. Different dinos as well as different mechanics in the DLC, not to mention an entire new F'ing world. I don't remember them ever saying there was going to be another world at all. Now there are 3? One of which is completely free, one comes with the game and one you have a pay for. The price is a bit high on the DLC but it's not cheap to make an entire world. There is no pay to win, There is no micro transations, how exactly do you think they are going to pay staff to add more content for you to play without paying them?I would also like to state that this game is a modder's Heaven. Not that many games support mods these days sadly. This game does have the development tools required to make some great mods, which i do use. Ok the initial content may run dry after a while. However the community is giving so much content to this game that is all free to enjoy. This is my first modded playthrough and i'm having a ball with it. Also worth noting is that the newer maps basically arn't finished yet. There are bugs and issues that some modders have run into, but \""The Island\"" the original map is supported fully. TL;DR: Honestly i believe this game is great, the DLC outrage is not warrented, especially as its far from required. almost 100 hours playtime here and never touched the free map let alone the paid one. Great game with one of the best modding communities i've ever seen.

The game itself is amazing. It's the simcity of your dreams, no really i'm not kidding, this is what simcity should have been. The simulation model works well, the ai adapts to new routes etc easily, and like i imagine happens in the real world people don't just instantly start taking the new roads you build, most of the time it takes a day for the first people to even start using your shiny new roads. It's almost a word of mouth system, where once 1 person uses it they tell people about the new road and it expands from there until its a basic part of the infrastructure. Everyone has their own houses, own work, own school locations etc, people do what people do, they are unpredictable in the most natural way, Traffic congestion is something to consider, but its not the stupid issue that it was in simcity. Sometimes if you plan poorly there will be consequences to your traffic plans, i for instance made a single intersection the hub of my city, while for a long time it was fine, after i placed by 3000th hex of industrial in the industical zone i soon found that my streets were filled with trucks transporting cargo to and from the industry buildings, in mass, like seriously mass there was hundreds, and everyone going in or out of my city had to take a single intersection, this lead to car jams that could span for miles, i even made a mistake on the entrance to my city too, that made the highway backup for miles aswell, this isnt as simple to fix as it may seem. but eventually i believe i have it fixed. but thats the key. IT IS FIXABLE. This is not like simcitys traffic system where once you get to the 10th hour your city is completely screwed. There are buses and trains and even boats! (Which i havent yet built i'll admit) i made a train station for cargo to ease some of the road congestion, however that actually made more traffic issues because everyone was taking a single road. so i made a road with the entire idea of having these trucks on it, they travel above everyone else and go straight to the industrial sectory, this effectively solved part of the issues i had been having, but frankly, like in the real world, there is no quick fix, you cant just build a single road and expect it to fix every problem, yes it will help and yes the ai is smart enough to know this new road is a better option for some of the population to take, but it is not going to instantly fix your problems in most cases.i have one and only one complaint i can level at this game, i have seen some issues with the vehicles running into each other and occasionally clipping through each other, but in most cases one of the vehicles will eventually realise they they are about to, or have hit someone and react as if the other person has right of way and will stop and fix the problem, this is PURELY a visual thing, there is no gameplay reprocussions at all. It is however a negitive to the game so i thought i would mention it. I have no issue at all recommending this game, the price is not even worth mentioning, i wish i'd not bought simcity and this cost twice as much, then i'd be getting my money. P.S. A quick tip, think about your roads, if your fire trucks can't get to a fire, you will loses houses...

I don't see what is making all the hate on this game, I have played a fair bit, and i find it very enjoyable. its kind of like, realm of the mad god upgraded. There are 3 things this game doesnt have that realm of the mad god has, full screen, permadeath and an oceanic server. Full screen i would like, it would make it a lot more enjoyable experience playing the game in my opinion. though i would like to state that realm of the mad god had weird scaling issues when it went to full screen so i'm not completely sure if i can count that as an advantage over this. As for perma-death, it is my most hated system UNLESS you have some kind of progression system in the game that is built upon death. like rogue leagacy's coins gathering mechanic. Realm of the Mad God took this idea and completely murdered it, making you spend real money to get what, in my opinion, should be the progression currency. (for example you need to buy gold coins to unlock more classes)Lastly the oceanic server, this is clearly purely because i live in australia, for most people this wouldnt be an issueBack to this game however, it has more classes, more abilities, it has a pet system which add active and passive abilities to your character. I guess you don't have things like Archer arrows penetrate but in Realm of the mad god but honestly, 4-6x the active abilities makes me not care. I see some people saying about the whole paying model? I mean yes it's there... It's a free to play game, are you new to the concept of in game stores to pay for bonuses? It's a very common free to play model and is, in my opinion, one of the best. Those who say they are constantly bombarded with things telling them to buy stuff or that it always opens windows going to their \""buy diamonds\"" page, i don't know what you're doing wrong but i've not had any of this at all. There is a little store button down the bottom? If you click on that you will go to the store i'm sure... Besides that, it's the normal free to play game stuff. I have played many free to play games and personally am quite used to the systems in place here.

Not only is the gameplay solid and very fluid as well as intuitive (Though control reminders are given passively in the bottom right corner if you need them). The graphics are amazing, Orc armor looks amazing and slowly gets better as the orcs rise in the ranks. The animation quality is off the charts, i don't believe i've ever seen a game to date with animation quality as good as this has. The animations don't even seem to clip or stutter as you switch between attack moves. I loved the music and sound assets aswell, very suiting to the world. Voice Overs are great quality, suit the characters yet still understandable (In relation to the orc voices).The story, if you are in to lord of the rings and the lore surrounding it you NEED this game. No question, I'm not a lore person, in most games i'll skip cut scenes and i did start on shadow of mordor too, but i don't even know when or how buut somehow i became invested in the storyline and i ended up watching all the cut scenes and the conclusion at the end is amazing, i loved every part of this story and that's not something i say usually.All in all this game is amazing, if i had anything negitive to say about it is that it is somewhat of a short game, steam clocks me at 20 hours at this point, i have completed the story and some of the side missions however, there are many many more. When the story finished i just wanted more. I am truely sad that the story finished. Amazing game, best i've played in a long time, and i am a hardcore gamer.""}]"

It is pretty much inserting yourself into the world of South Park, interacting with the world and its characters in fun and humorous ways.The gameplay itself isn't that bad either, anyone familar with the battle systems of games like Paper Mario will adapt quick to this and its easy enough to pick up even if you haven't. However one thing I will criticise the game for is the lack of depth for character progression, your max level caps out at 15 and given how much you can progress your abilities, a max level of 25 I feel would have been better suited.Aside from that, there are a lot of weird and wonderful weapons that you can acquire during the game from Darts to dodgeballs to vibrating \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. Also many costume pieces can be found, each with their own passives attached such as extra armor or a boost in fire damage.These pieces can be customised further through the use of 'Strap-ons' to give extra benefits like causing bleeding, giving more armor and even recovering hp and pp on perfect attacks.The game provides choices in the game but really they do little to effect the game's story, just more something you will do for achievements and choosing who you will fight later on until a point where the two sides merge.Also hope you like references, cause the game is full of them from the show such as the 30 Chimpokomon you can collect during the course of the game to well known references from the show. As for those who will be affected by the censorship the game's makers put in, I found they don't really do much to spoil anything, just two minigames though I think some audio dialogue in the second half of the game (least in the Australian version) is cut out as well, or just my sound card \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing sucks, either or which.All in all it's a solid rpg for those interested and also a game for diehard fans of South Park to enjoy, however I would suggest avoiding it if you are the sort of person easily offended by the style of crude humor shows like South Park provide.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted September 23, 2015."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited September 23, 2015."", ""item_id"": ""9880"", ""helpful"": ""5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""I have some praises for this game but for those who are looking for a good f2p experience, this is almost definitely not your game.So I'm gonna make this clear here and now.You are probably not going to have much fun with this game unless you sink some money into it since its where most of the content lies. Champions Online is an MMO with a superhero theme to it if it was not obvious enough. I started playing this way back in the day probably as early as 2011 though I didn't really seriously pick it up until maybe around 2013. I played for a while and unlocked one of the 'gold' archtypes with real money. I played, made a character, tried to make a story and such out of it since the game seems to encourage you to do that with the nemesis system and all.But again most of fun doesn't really happen until you either unlock a freeform slot with money separately or you get a gold sub for the game which you can do on different terms like monthly and yearly from memory or you can do what I did and dig in for the lifetime sub that lasts until the game inevitably shuts down.Doing this allow you to access freeform slots which are basically slots in which you can customise every aspect of your character from primary and secondary main stats, powers and skill trees, This is where most of the fun can come into it since you can make the character how you want it instead of having to follow a set skill system but unfortunate it is behind a paywall.That said though from the last time I played it, the game is pretty dead, there are people around yes but maybe 4-500 tops on good days. The end content is kind of dull as well getting your usual dailies and such though there are special 'comic' missions that are basically mini campaigns separate from the main story. Rampages are where you will probably spend most of your time when you get to max level (which is 40 btw) cause it's where you need to farm the materials for the best equipment in the game. Drop rates are pretty bad so you are going to have to grind for quite a while to get anything to drop for you and even then you need like 6 of each item (add there are about 3-4 different rampage items) in order to make a full set of armour and if you have multiple characters, be ready for the long grind.The game is also microtransactions galore from costume sets to powers to 'lockboxes' which are boxes you need to open with keys that cost 100 Zen a piece which is the premium currency for the game in order to unlock special costumes and vehicles that only come from those lockboxes, or just wait until they turn up in the auction house for a pretty penny (ie stupidity expensive cause price gouging is popular with players in the game).However all of that I did ignore cause if there is one praise I have for thise game it's the pretty robust character creation system where you can select from a ton of different options (a lot are premium parts but once unlocked they are unlocked amongst all character and future ones on your account). You can be an undead superhero, a mad scientist, an Iron Man wannabe, or if you are me, create a tiger that kicks \u2665\u2665\u2665 with martial arts or uses firearms to blow away minions.Story is pretty bland in a lot of places and some of the voice acting/lip and body animations will leave you cringing as you meet characters that are pretty clear ripoffs of superheroes like Iron Man, The Flash and organisations like S.H.I.E.L.D.Do I recommend this game? If you have the cash you are willing to input into the game for a gold sub then maybe yes but this game has a lot of things that needs fixing before it's close to anything mainstream. However if you can look past that, you can really get lost in the character creation system, creating many different heroes with varying powers from fire to poison to demonic powers to kinetic force.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted May 13."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""399070"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""It's a short game yes as I finished it in about an hour but that hour has you playing a sad but heartwarming story about a baby dragon as he explores an unknown world and done entirely without the need for dialogue.

It lets you glide across the starting map and later on Sector 0 as you progress through the story, however that said its not always clear about exactly how extensive the range of what you can grab onto which can lead to a halt in flow or in some cases, death by gravity.There are colletibles in this game but I didn't care much for them and challenges are also present do 'x' in 'x' time, you know the drill. Some can be hard to do though and for someone like me who can sometimes take a game too seriously it does not help when the challenge giver insults you sometimes after failing said challenge.The crafting system is decent enough allowing you to craft things from medkits to throwing stars to elemental explosives later on when you unlock the ability to. However that said, the last boss of the game is an absolute joke, its basically one big QTE and you'd think they would have not done this since the last boss from Dead Island was good though bs in it's own right but that's just my opinion.In summary though I think it's a game worth playing for sure, the crafting system allows for some nice weapons, the parkour is fun and overall a good time.

Elizabeth I will admit like many others is probably the best sidekick character to date, he is useful in battle with passing ammo, health, eve, opening tears etc and she does not need to be babysat like so many escort missions that could be named (RE4 anyone?).The Bad: While there is a nice variety of Vigors to use, you'll probably get to a point where you only stick with the use of two or three throughout most of the game. Controls are kind of weird but least you can rebind keys since I am one who does ADS a lot and having to press V to do so is kind of weird. Burial at Sea Ep 1:The Good: Seeing Rapture remade in the new engine is certainly a sight to behold and offers for a nice setting for this story. Elizabeth is useful like always, passing necessary supplies when needed and seeing familar characters from past Bioshock games are a welcome addition as well. New plasmid is useful at points and offers a new use in combat but I will touch on this again in the badThe Bad/Neutral: Length is nothing special, price I used to call into question until I began hearing of other games being even shorter and charging even more (some may know what I am referring to). New plasmid is useful at points and offers a new use in combat but it reminds me too much of the Winter Blast plasmid from the original Bioshock so its not really a new thing persay. Story was alright though not too sure what to think on it.Burial at Sea Ep 2:The Good: Play as Elizabeth finally, being able to see things through her eyes and even offers some more conversations between her and 'Booker', you'll know what I mean if you played it. Peeping Tom, a very useful plasmid to have to keep constant awareness of your surroundings, being able to see enemies through walls and turn invisible to set up sneak attacks on enemies. Provides a section where you take a trip back to Columbia so nice they did that.The Bad/Neutral: I am not too fond on the focus on stealth this time around though in thought, it does sort of makes sense since Elizabeth would be a more fragile character compared to Booker. No Tear control or even creation? I mean what the hell, it was a major component in both the main game and BAS ep 1 and they take it away? Lost points there with me. And the ending, oh god I hated that ending. It sort of makes sense but really even so that ending spoiled the time I waited for this DLC and it felt like a really sour way to make the curtain call with Irrational shutting down to move to Take Two Interactive. Then again I am the type of person who prefers a general happy ending like the good ending from the original Bioshock.Do I recommend this game? Yes for the most part, the gameplay is good throughout all eps though some may get turned off by the gameplay style change in BAS ep 2. Not much of a happy ending for your favourite characters either so while in one life they may be alright, in this one there is nothing much happy to be seen here.But the story is deep and intricate as it is but for someone like me who prefers an overall happy ending for the game and its characters, not really my favourite part of the game.Take it how you will.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted December 26, 2013."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""550"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Left 4 Dead 2 is critically acclaimed by a lot of people but I didn't find it all that, like so many other people.

The narrative and historical facts you pick up during the game are a great addition and you will learn a few things about life in World War 1. The gameplay is quite basic, with puzzles being quite simple and can get quite repetative at times but are still enjoyable. My only criticism is that the 'skill' based action sequences can get quite annoying and you find yourself dieing a lot. You will find yourself passing them wth simply trial and error.

It also has one of the best soundtracks in gaming history that I still listen to months after finishing the game. There is a steep difficulty curve with learning the controls and that god-forsaken parry mechanic, and the game's length does not give you sufficient time to master the mechanics in one playthrough. You'll probably spend that time getting your butt whooped.However, the game invites you to play it multiple times, as there are multiple difficulty settings, challenge missions, a variety of gadgets, weapons and instruments of death and dismemberment at your disposal, allowing for a variety of playstyles and present a number of different solutions for the stealth segments. Yes, there are stealth segments. But when you can dispatch a whole bunch of cyber-mooks and reduce them all to iron filings without taking damage, you will feel like an angel of death.The writing is a little cringe-worthy and cutscenes drag on like you're watching an anime, and in the true anime style, the tone jumps from dark and serious to awkward attempts of being comedic, to over-the-top and dramatic, but I can forgive it, as the storytelling still holds my interest, has a memorable cast of characters and the MGR:R experience as a whole is just really, really fun.

No, really. Sure, you can count the number of pixels your character is made up of, but the simple, low-res style is compensated for by great lighting effects and clever use of line-of-sight, as well as a sense of nostalgia, mostly of DOS games. With it's top down shooter style reminiscent of Flash games, simple and intuitive controls and inventory and crafting system, the game world itself carries a highly atmospheric setting and a compelling story that you unlock piece by piece at computer terminals ingame. There's a great amount of tension and uncertainty as you shoot, salvage, sort your items and ultimately try to survive, unsure of how long you're going to last. The gameplay is very challenging but not overly unfair, and satisfying from the very start.Not a lot of roguelikes catch my interest but Teleglitch creates a gameplay experience that always stays fresh.

Kills made by explosives will mostly torn your character into pieces, and usually the extremities will the ones getting off the bodies, arms legs, sometimes the head or half torso, etc. There's too much detail. The little isssue is when someone is getting shot there's gonna be a lot of blood splatting per hit, most games would make the blood be spilled and stay on the surfaces, this game doesn't do much of that, but it's that much of an issue.The combat skills such are TIER 1 and TIER 2 in most characters are fitting on science fiction and real science, such as optical cloak (this is an example) is not necessarily accurate due the movility would disturb this ability; you can \""download\"" the TIER 1 version of the team mate if they use a TIER 2 skills, it's temporal and weaker but still near similar to the original character whom you downloaded the TIER skill, works as long as you're near host of the TIER skill and up to 3 other players that are not you.There's currently two female ressembling characters on this game.I could say more of this, but I think this is enough for now, this game is great for casual play or competitive play if it gets further such as having a competitive community, it has the potential for it.I give it 10/10 shooter game with science fiction and covert arts.""}]"

If you\u2019re looking for a powerful narrative experience with a lot to say, The Beginners Guide is a must, but to many others this will be a pretentious, difficult experience.The Beginners Guide is the latest creation of Davey Wreden, the man behind The Stanley Parable. The Beginners Guide draws a lot from The Stanley Parable, including the meta interpretation of games, a first person experience through an enclosed environment, and an omniscient narrator. Unlike Stanley however, Guide is a very linear experience which directly funnels the player through a series of random and abstract environments. All the while, Wreden\u2019s assured voice permeates through the experience, explaining what you are \u2018playing\u2019 and where it derives from. Ultimately the story told is about a man simply called Coda, and how making short games was an outlet for him to escape from his anxiety and depression.Its a fascinating way to tell a story, and touches on many powerful emotional beats and twists. Not only that, but the story comments on recurring ideas about videogames themselves \u2013 the relationship between player and designer, the interpretation of games and the experience of the player itself. Its very thoughtful and well-told, although I would criticise the end by being a bit too clear-cut. Personally I think having a more ambiguous ending would have been better for the experience of the player, simply as it would force them to piece it all together. Simply put, Guide does sometimes rely too heavily on showing rather than telling, which is not a particularly stellar storytelling technique.The entire game also drips with gorgeous design and music. The little creations you go through are varied and vast, but still tightly constructed and the music along with Wreden\u2019s voice leads to a palpable atmosphere of discovery and emotion. However, your enjoyment of the game doesn't rely on the story or the atmosphere. Its dependant on your expectations \u2013 what you expect the game to be, and what you hope to take away from that experience. Experience is probably a better word for The Beginners Guide than game. At only 90 minutes long, this is more of a lightly interactive movie, and if you\u2019re hoping for anything less you\u2019re going to be disappointed - but if you are looking for a purely well-told story, powerful emotional resonance and commentary on interesting issues I cannot recommend this game highly enough.Narrative-Driven: Must-playIndie Gamers: Must-playCasual Gamers: MehHarcore Gamers: Recommended""}]"

At launch this game was buggy as hell and I hope ubisoft learned that is better to delay a release (or beta first) rather than release an inferior product - 2. Never underestimate the intelligence of your audience , they will find out about your review embargo3. Never Ever ever put in-app-pruchases in a AA title it is very bad taste , and makes fans weary for the time they can only complete the game after buying another $100 worth of stuff on a game they already spent $80 on.4. They did make it a bit more challenging but please note the ability to dodge(hand shield) a ranged attack is needed5. The gameplay is mind numbingly repetitive ,parkour to waypoint, sneak/smoke bomb, kill done rinse repeat, the investigation thing is a bit nice but also very predictable and can usually be solved by looking at the first 2 clues6. Health potions , Now armed with 2 smokebombs and filled up on health potions you can take down a battalion with zero to no effort ( what ever happened to running)7. Smoke bombs mid battle used to be easy , now since patch 3 I become a pincushion when trying to smokebomb .The good 1. Huge open world2. Challenging fights (occasionally)3. Good Story line (Black flag was excellent), this is a bit predictable 4. Stunning visuals ( making my quad core high spec pc work for the money I spent on it)Since Update 31. Crashes are fewer and far between ,2. Having some trouble jumping out of some windows from inside the building. collisions problems3. Sometimes blocking attacks will not block at the point of attack (example she sparks will fly on the left where the enemy attacked from the right.4.  crowd seem smarter but some folks are still doing a 1 meter drop especially when i start to run.If you wish to play Assassins Creed and don't have black flag rather buy black flag its far better value if you want to purchase this game rather wait for the price to drop to $20 , the only reason why I see value is because i got season pass and ubisoft gave a free game (farcry 4) with it and a free dlc.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted October 29, 2014."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited November 1, 2014."", ""item_id"": ""72850"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Love this game everything about it keep the same level of exciting gameplay Oblivion provided and the modability makes it a worthwile investment , along with 2 stunning dlc's (because les be honest heartfire is ok but there are better 3rd party mods out there) --ESO Rant----Playing this also brings me great agony over the Elderscrolls Online release, I am sure this direction was taken by some who did not truly appriicate the last 3 releases.

If anything, check out the mods, at least they are free, and just generally better. Epoch is quite good as you get fairly solid base building tools, vehicle modifications and random missions against bandits, mad scientists, heroes, and treasure hunters. Even with the best of PCs this game runs horribly. It's hard enough trying to survive in this game without your frame rate dropping to the point where you can't even aim to kill a zombie or player who is trying to kill you. Add to that the insane amount of cheaters and combat loggers and it is basically a death match, with random chances to die for no reason being extremely common (e.g. stand up in a house, die because the floor breaks your legs). Also, logging in and finding that a really nice piece of clothing or bullet proof vest you have has somehow become ruined (and thus damaging all of the gear in the clothing inventory slots) is common, and really frustrating. RIP plate carrier vest with gun pouch and Gorka military pants/jacket. May 2015 - May 2015, I crie evrytiem.I can't fathom why this game is priced so highly for early access, not when full release indie games (which can offer a much better experience) are usually lower in price. Elements that have been fixed for a long time in the mod (helicopter crashes, persistence, lack of loot) are suddenly broken in the standalone. Even new elements introduced into the standalone are broken later when something else is changed.This game might be more worthwhile when it is finished, but in its current state it is really not worth it.

There are currently 4 or 5 different types of missions which range from Exterminating enemies, to capturing wanted enemies & killing enemies to keep your oxygen levels up.WarFrames can all be obtained for FREE or by buying them for a CASH SHOP currency called Platnium. Most players find them as it isn't hard but it can be very very repetative (The whole game is very very very much so) At this time there are a range of 17 or 18 frames available to players & each one has abilities that are unique to that frame.Weapons & WarFrames can be upgraded by adding or removing mod cards that players get while doing missions (They are dropped by some of the enemies) This can give the weapon extra attributes that can make it do a few very helpful things like dealing certain types of damage. (Like Radiation damage or Viral damage etc)The level system in WarFrame is a bit different from the sort most people will have encountered in most other games in that a player gains Mastery Points only by actually using weapons & frames so they level up. Everything has a level cap of level 30 as far as Frames & weapons go & ATM the highest level available to players Mastery is level 15 or 16 (Cant remember atm sorry)WarFrame was a let down for myself as I have been playing for some time during it's development & it seems to have stalled hard. It has been turned into a grind fest with players having to basically do the same type of missions all the time from the vey lowest levels to the very highest. I wouldn't recommend the game to people I know in real life as it currently stands, & hopefully the developers will find the right track & make the game good again""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted June 11, 2015."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""301520"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Nice game where you build your own robot from the ground up!Is even better now they have done a lot more work to how matching is done & the restrictions have brought things a long way.Easy as hell to play & \""ALWAYS FUN\"" for ALL AGES!""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted February 18, 2015."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""317360"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""D.A.B is another one of those FPS style shooters where there really is no point to playing other than killing each other. Although the game is easy to master it very quickly becomes boring to play as other than 2 or 3 minutes of server directed mission the only other thing to do is kill each other while basically doing a very very limited number of stunts for points.Your character is controlled by the usual Keys (W,A,S,D) & the mouse & the key binbdings can be customised.Most of the maps are not real big & most of the weapons are able to shot from one side all the way to the other. ATM there are at least 1 of the weapons in the game that are OverPowered but you are able to choose from 2 types of pistols & 3 or 4 types of rifles from M16 through to a Shotgun.There is no real way of boosting health back up once you have lost it other than dying & respawning at full health again. When killed there is basically NO drawback as everything in the game is FREE & available to ALL players ALL the time.D.A.B is not a game I would recommend to anyone that asked me though at the moment as the game is currently struggling to keep the few players it still has. (There are at least 100 characters playing the game by the Leader Board around the world) At some times of the day you will struggle to find a server with more than 6-8 players on it & just about every day you will struggle to find more than 40 or 50 in total online at any one time.The graphics for the game are not bad but they suffer from a few bugs still in some places. I would guess that just about any computer could handle this game at it's lowest settings but am not sure what the minimum system reqs are.D.A.B has inbuilt Voice communications ability & all a player really needs is their headset & they are able to talk to other players in the same game as they are. Having to put up with some of the younger people that use the Voice comms can be very frustrating though as they tend to make stupid noises & stupid voices over it. (ATM I am not sure if you are able to MUTE individual players which is maybe something they will do in the future)In summing up I really can't recommend that ANYONE take the time to download this game as it is very much dying ATM due to a FAST growing number of HACKERS that basically wreck the game for 15 minutes for everyone else by 1 shoting other players which doesn't give you a chance as most of the weapons in the game take several shots to kill another player with so you always loose to trying to face off with them.Maybe if the developers do something about the lack of in the game then the game would be a whole lot better, but with the hackers, the lack of much to do ingame & the repetitiveness I think they might have a HUGE task infront of them that they just may not be able to complete.So try it if you must but don't say I didn't warn you!""}]"

I have not regretted its purchase at all. Despite a few glitches - nothing major, the game is exceptional. Don't expect to run around shooting etc. There are times of frustration, but as with many games, revisiting areas etc are the key and can fix times where you 'hit the wall'.

At first I recommended it to everyone, however, the more people I played with, the more problems (that could be fixed easily by updates) seemed to arise. Maps, content or textures that people had already owned would not register when they tried to play the game and either resulted in the person not being able to join the server at all (wouldn't even let them download the missing items from the workshop), or joining a server with huge error signs and checkers causing massive lag.10/10 for fun and entertainment, 0/10 for ease of playing.

When I bought this game it had a discount I was so interested in it because it was fun, After my first 2 hours of playing it and a few minutes, I kept experiencing game crashes on this game when I choose a character skin or when I'm playing it. After it crashes, the screen becomes black, then it just said said \""Video Device Removed Or Rest\"" I saw some forums about this and some other people complaining why is this happening.....

Unlike other games you need to invest a large portion of time leveling a basic infantry soldier before you can unlock recon. Once you unlock recon you are then able to use a scoped bolt action, this is great however the scope is so blurry and does not zoom in very far. You are better off trying to scout and aim at enemies using your binoculars then quickly switching to your gun and taking a shot hoping the target doesn't move as binoculars zoom in about 5 times more and is clear.Previously the scope on the recon rifles were like that of the binoculars however with the recent patch recon is a waste of time.If you want to drive a tank or fly a plane this game still has its up sides however if you play recon like me spend your 500+ hours playing something else.""}]"

The multiplayer is fun, the graphics are good and it is enjoyable to play. Enemy types vary and require different tactics to defeat, making you plan your towers, weapons and perks carefully. I would've liked to see upgrading your primary and secondary weapons through the game, and a selection of primary weapons for each class, but it doesn't bug me too much. The story is barely there, with about two comic-like pictures before each level, and besides the map and enemies, gameplay doesn't change much between levels. Sure, you get new towers, secondary weapons and perks as you go along, but I was hoping on each level that some flying spaceship thing would come and help. The boss fights are really fun, as the boss destroys your buildings and fuels your rage to  destroy it. Without any expansions the story is short aswell, but it does get hard and can take a bit of grinding. The amount of detail put into each map is brilliant aswell, with little bits to explore and objects to interact with. Overall, this is a nice game to play with your friends, by yourself and sometimes with random people over the internet (Unless they hop in on the last wave, destroy all your towers before you notice and have time to act, then leave). 7.5/10""}]"

BUT the other map is EPIC it is huge, filled with towns, militairy bases, barns and more with awesome and I mean AWESOME weapons and other materials for you to use to survive the undead world. But the multiplayer is a let down since you can hardly get into a server in fact i don't even know if you CAN get into a server with the complication of ip's, port's and stuff but the developer might update that so I still recommend this game because of the EPIC singleplayer and if your thinking what the controls will be like and if they are like DayZ's alien controls then don't worry the controls on Unturned are great and you can adjut them if you want anyway. Oh and there is stuff like customization to your character. WOW this is alot like DayZ but just with Minecraft themed graphics. So much to do in this game and it's FREE so i suggest you go and annihilate some zombies in Unturned!""}]"

Highly recommended for people who want a good shooter to play for free.The features that set this above and apart all others are:- Very fair pricing: With minimal play time, it\\'s possible to get a 50,000 credit hero permanently unlocked in 1-2 weeks. If you play each game mode every day and win once, you get 2,000 credits everyday and you can get 1,500-3,000 if you complete the objectives that cycle every 3 hours. No change in power above bronze cards.- High skill requirements: There\\'s very little auto-aim (1 turret class) and a lot of hip-firing skill is required. Against snipers, small HP mercs move fast and there\\'s ample flanking paths. Tank classes are usually balanced by slow movement or needing medics and fire support characters to feed them. - Massive focus on teamplay: Success is highly dependent on your team having a medic, fire support, engineer, assault and recon. At high levels you\\'re going to need serious co-ordination between your team.- You can still carry: Despite the requirement for team-play, a good player is easily recognised in Dirty Bomb. You may not win but you\\'ll make the other team pay hard. With enough skill, a medic could keep the entire team healed and push the opposition back.- Varied heroes: All mercs are functionally distinct and highly balanced. Each merc has specific loadouts and skills that contribute to the game.- Server browser: Wish other games had this. Negatives are:- Matchmaking: Sometimes you\\'re going to up against stacked teams.- Loadout system: You have a fixed loadout that others may not like as it forces them into a specific weapon / augment they may not like. Fortunately, bronzes are relatively cheap. - RNG: You can select the hero that you want to get a loadout, but the cheapest path requires RNG. Special events also have a lot of RNG involved. However, you can buy a bronze loadout you want with in-game credits for 17,500 credits. - Minor glitches: I\\'ve had a little rubber banding here and there. High ping players seem to teleport around every now and then. Nothing major. - Hackers: Relative to other F2P shooters, though, Dirty Bomb has a very low hacker problem.

Also i'm playing on survival difficulty and i've killed over 100 legendaries and I get \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 all drops wtf? I can mod a 10mm pistol and its better than 99% of the legendary weapons. I might as well playing on easy. Stuff like hacking, lockpicking and speech is still there to finish quest but honestly just killing them is the better way to finish quest now. Also not a fan of the unlimited, repetitive quest system like the ones Preston Garvey gives you. Just keep clearing  random camps with no purpose to them, like what? It's so lazy from the developers, there's less actual side quest than previous games (less interesting as well) as a result of this implementation of the unlimited quest system.Anyways combats a lot better in this game then fallout 3 and NV but everything else is worse. Questing, leveling(having a level cap is better because it gives the chracters you make identity, like a melee focused character or a explosive focused character, now you can be everything and clear every skill tree its so dumb), factions are worse than NV, story is okay and the dialogue tree is terrible.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted March 11."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""383870"", ""helpful"": ""1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""The ending sucked, there was tis massive build up, and it just ended in like 30 seconds, with some anti-climatic explanation.

It incorporates elements of minecraft, with the crafting, building and general look of the game, whilst also including core elements from day z - with survival elements of food, water, sickness, blood becoming important. You'll spend a lot of time raiding towns for crucial gear and a lot of time fighting zombies who literally cannot be \""de-aggro'd\"" (the old \""walk through some trees and lose the zombies\"" doesn't apply here). The fun increases exponentially when you play with a friend, you can create a base using the massive and (mostly) easy to follow crafting menu/crafting wiki. Setting up a base is a very satisfying experience but it should be noted that players and zombies can destroy and player built structure. The game runs smoothly at the lowest settings on my potato of a rig, but I\u2019ve noticed that any attempt to increase the graphics leads to excessive fps drop. The lowest settings are still significantly better than minecraft graphics, though, so fear not. Currently there is not a server browser for unturned, this makes playing online somewhat of a tedious adventure.. Currently your best bet of finding a server is trolling through the steam servers and hoping to find an IP address/server that isn't full and is actually hosting at the time. I've personally had more success with hamachi servers than the standard IP ones, but even then it's very hit and miss. IF you can find a good PVP server it is great fun and I\u2019d highly recommend trying it out. The survival elements on a PVP match can be too unforgiving though, and frequently you die of starvation/thirst (of course player related deaths are common, too). But there's nothing quite like hunting down the player who killed you last and killing them with three awfully aimed body shots from your scavenged mosin nogant (praise the Russians for their weapon prowess) and then stealing their poncho and tea-bagging the absolute \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of their raided, bullet ridden corpse (rip never 4get). Whilst on the topic of player v player combat, BULLETS HURT and you bleed quite significantly after being shot. This is a great bit of realism that makes pvp skirmishes that much more strategic. I'll probably never forget having to use my trousers as a bandage to stop the bleeding from a bullet wound incurred from a friend who was \""trying to test the range of the rifles\"", what a fething scrubl0rd. I have some gripes about the crafting system, namely how difficult it is to find a canteen or to craft one. I fail to see why we can't use an empty tin can/water bottle to collect water, in fact I fail to see why we can't just drink from the water using the players block like hands (dafuq?). Also it is quite difficult to craft new magazines using empty magazines and combining them with boxes of ammunition. This is mostly due to the fact that empty magazines take up one free inventory slot EACH and cannot be stacked like regular magazines/shells. This makes finding/creating a dependable supply of magazines quite frustrating. I do however like the fact that empty magazines drop to the ground (unless it's your last one) when you reload, this system makes it much more realistic. But it's still an early access game so these things maybe changed in the future.DESPITE THIS, the game is epic. It is free. It is fun to play. It's hilarious with friends AND for a measly 50mb download you literally have no reason not to give it a try. TLDR; Great game get on it scrubl0rds. ""}]"

While most game developers would aim to build on existing positives, X Rebirth's devs have taken everything GOOD about the original games, and thrown them completely out of the window in order to squeeze in some \""pretty new graphics\"", which in all honesty, aren't that impressive to begin with and seem more of a throwback to mid 2000's graphics engines. The removal of third person views, multiple ship control, gate travel (a new \""taxi tube\"" system has been developed to shuttle your ship from system to system, which is absolutely TERRIBLE) and many \""new features\"" are actually fancy detractions from what made the original X series so great. The addition of being able to walk around in stations sounded great at first, but is extremely limited in it's function and serves no great logical purpose to the game that couldn't be solved easier with menus and communications channels, except to make the game boringly and frustratingly mundane each time you are forced to wander around stations upon docking. Trade is just about non-functional, often causing game-breaking errors and lockups, and combat although beautiful to watch is just as broken. I am sorry to say that I was duped into pre-ordering this game with the promise of great things...

Rarely will you ever come across repetitive tedious hard labour as hideous as this. The occassional bug that lets you fall thru the floor or get trapped in a wall comes as a refreshing break in the horrid mix of broken gameplay and cut-scenes which take away any weapon upgrades you have fought hard to achieve, either by switching you back to the single hand gun or simply removing all other weapons from your inventory, leaving you wondering why you worked so hard to get other weapons and ammo supplies, or even why they were dangled there to temp you in the first place.The most horrid aspect of fighting in MP3 would have to be this \""last man standing\"" feature which takes away all control in a gun fight and forces you to target on a single enemy who has dealt you a mighty blow, and somehow you are supposed to enjoy suddenly ripping your attention away from the fierce battle that had your full attention, and shoot just one enemy in slow motion, if you can, before dying.  Personally I would prefer if the game let me just do my own thing in a battle, and if I am hit with a killing shot then so be it.  Let me use my meds and battle sense to do it my way.  Last-man-standing is probably the most hateful feature I have ever encountered in a game.  Have I missed a feature that lets me turn that off?The greatest wonder I am left with is WHY I have spent so much time trying to complete this game and why I have not simply deleted all traces of it from my pooter.""}]"

If you like puzzle games, then I'd highly recommend Antichamber. The game is non-linear, if you get stuck on something you can leave it for later and continue with the game elsewhere. This means you can avoid the frustration of not being able to progress, and makes for a relaxing and interesting experience. The sound design and sountrack is amazing, various different atmospheric soundscapes play, all with a trance like feel to them. The minimalistic surroundings work well in this game, using colours and shapes to guide you and distinguish different areas. As you progress you 'unlock' various metaphors and sayings which both tell several stories, as well as help you progress.The programming is incredibly well done and the \""Impossible Geometry\"" seen in art work is brought to life and utilised in creating a surreal experience. The controls are easy to use, and the game mechanics are incredibly unique. The only problems I encountered were due to my keyboard, and the innability I had to change key bindings, but this hardly affected gameplay. And if you want a game with a lot of replay value, this mightn't be the one. Before the game's end, you can return to places you've been and follow different routes to find new areas, however once you've solved a puzzle it's easy to do it again without much thought.""}]"

A complete waste of money that now seems to make up a quarter of what the season pass provides. As it was recently announced that their would be only one campaign DLC for the pre sequel, I am left to wonder whether this $20 is even going to be worth it in the end. The one redeeming factor so far is that it seems like the character DLC's are very well made and hopefully this can make up for the pile of excrement that is the Holodome.

The protagonist is just a guy who feels sorry for himself and thinks too much, heaps of inner dialogue that jump from one topic to the next not really serving any purpose besides telling the reader what we already know from a paragraph or so in; he feels sorry for himself. Instead of assuming we know that by now, this concept gets dragged on for such a long time making -me- feel sorry for myself as he goes on and on about his boring lifestory. I think what makes it really hard for me to continue playing is my lack of interest in the protagonist as a character I will have to put up with the whole visual novel through. While I understand his sentiments and probably the purpose of him being so lifeless before he gets to the actual camp and 'lives it up' or something like that, I still don't get it and I don't agree with the execution. Another thing that bothered me was the blurr effects in the beginning when he looks around his room. I don't quite understand the purpose of that and it just annoyed me. Is he still sleepy or something? Why can't he talk about that instead of how ordinary and uninteresting his life is? At least that would serve an actual purpose.Like I said, I haven't played much and I wanted to give it a chance but it is what it is. It may be considered as a 'visual novel loved by many' in the description but I'm sorry, count me out. It just isn't for me.Soviet Games, I hope you continue making more visual novels to come with your beautiful assets and put more thought into the writing delivery/ cut out the unnecessary bits because the length of a story doesn't equal quality.

I don't want to hate NMS but it's just not very good in ways that would have been easily fixable. Truth is this game is too simplistic and there isn't much to it, but it's at the same time very fiddly. The exploration and planets don't make up for this and a lot of what you might have seen in the teaser trailers can't be found in-game. Even the way the game itself was portrayed is different enough that it left me wondering why. On the plus side I did play it fairly obsessively for 15 hours but after that I got sick of doing the same thing over and over again. I jumped past five systems in a row without stopping out of sheer boredom.

You can basically meet all sorts of people in the community, nicer or less nicer, from where you can choose to play further. This is why it's very competitive. From time to time, you can experience minor bugs but they don't downgrade the experience.In conclusion, I give this game 10/10, one of the best old games out there!""}, {""funny"": ""1 person found this review funny"", ""posted"": ""Posted December 23, 2015."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""322330"", ""helpful"": ""4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""It's a nice survival and crafting game for a definitely good price.

Story is engaging, and the visuals are pretty good for a relativley simple setup.However, the random 'encounters' if you will, realy need to be tweaked. Having 3 events that remove 2 health each and require 20+ points to address is an instant restart. Or else watch your crewmen die in 1, maybe 2 turns.This game is fun enough to play, just dont expect any real progression until it has been balanced a lot more.Also- cut scenes are not skipable with the mouse.

For a Free to Play game it's quite easy to advance without buying \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, infact, I got myself an ATV, full set of decent armor, 2 pistols, ammo and pleanty of weapons, I even went on raids with some friends I met through a clan. Just thinking about all this makes me feel kind of sad, sad that I haven't played it in ages, and those firends have left, never to be seen again. The gameplay is pretty grindy, but advancing and getting better gear is very rewarding and the game world is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ING HUGE HOLY \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, I once set out on my horse, travelled the lands for abut 3 hours straight, I ended up in some huge rusty old town, I have no clue if I will ever find the town I first set out in ever again.

Its amazing. I have lost track of how many times ive run for my life only to end up being eaten by something else entirely - but i keep going back for more! :DThis survival game is unique, fascinating, exciting and sometimes damn frustrating. Everytime you log onto the ARK you can find something new. No two days on the ARK are the same. One day you could be stalking raptors for an eligable partner in crime. The next, freezing to death while scouting on your pteradon. Or even on the next, being impaled by an angry Trike you accidently hit while foraging.Thats another thing:  there are soooo many dinosaurs! Rex's, Raptors, Stegos, Brontos, Anklos, even Mammoths! (yes, i know they're not dinos. stay with me). You name it and im pretty sure its in this game - or will be very soon. The Devs are constantly working on it with bug fixes, dino updates etc. The dino-pool is ever expanding! Plus there's a decent ancient-mammal-pool too. And between you and me, only MOST of them want to eat you ;) Summing up, this game is awesome and unpredictable, and that keeps it ever fresh and exciting. Money well spent in my opinion :D""}]"

And you may have noticed the fact the title is partnered with the ostentatious declaration of \""game of the year edition\"". One of my biggest problems with this game is that it does not deserve such a title. A more appropriate accolade would probably have to simply be \""Deus Ex: Game of century edition\"".Yes, that's right, I found a game that's better than Half-life 2, deal with it 2012 me!This is the part where one usually describes what the game is and a bit about the gameplay, but Deus ex has an exception. But, as a rule of thumb, most people classify it under the simple and undeserving title of \""FPS\"", a name unworthy of such a masterpiece. This is due to the seamless blend of RPG elements, Stealth and, of course, First person gameplay of the shooting variety (and no, Fallout 3 is not a \""better example\"" because Bethesda never quite grasped what the words \""role-playing\"" mean, and give out skill points in as plentiful quantities as the loading time in their games due to the excessive consolization that plagues this industry like the Grey death). Of course, the game is much more complex than this, as you are not necessarily limited to sneaking around urban dystopia and secret laboratories. One can simply go in guns blazing (but this usually results in immediate death) or, in contrast, can complete the entire game without killing a SINGLE person whatsoever. The amount of choice and the way it reacts to your decisions is frightenly high.But, nothing is perfect. The gunplay is fairly weak and the graphics and animations are fairly dodgy, due to it running of the already fairly dated unreal engine. The levels, whilst very expansive and well designed, are a bit boxy and bland, even within the context of a ruined 2052 cyberpunk setting. Its true strength, however, lies within its story. Without spoiling too much it revolves around the player, a \""nano-augmented\"" agent (don't worry, it is kind of explained in-game) called JC Denton, who works for UNATCO (United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition), a group formed by the united nations in response to increasing global tensions, including a terrorist strike on the statue of liberty (the game was made in 2000, so it was still perfectly fine to discuss terrorist attacks on New York). But as the player fights the various organizations, he starts to realise there is something very wrong with his overlords, and finds himself a player in a secret war for world dominance. The themes, factions and events in the game are likely from a conspiracy theorist's nutty dream, but simply keeping up to date wiht the state of the world simply provides foreshadowing for the dystopia presented in this game! Whilst most of the exposition and dialogue is extremely well written, its delivery and voice acting is not as refined, simply watch any play through of Hong Kong or Paris to get the idea. But, I suppose there is some charm to hearing Asian triads debate about philosophy in silly accents!On the subject of sound, it is quite obvious that the music does an excellent job of making up for the questionable voice acting. When you first boot up a game and simply get chills from the title screen, you know you've got a gem in your hands! All the the levels have an apprpaite soundtrack that suits them, with seperate themes for ambient, combat, conversations and death. Ah Hong Kong, never again will I be able to go anywhere remotely Asian without feeling like stepping into Wan Chai market for the first time...My final word is that you should absolutely buy this game. It is very cheap ($1.74 in a sale!) and there is simply no excuse for not playing this. There is a well-known phrase that \""Every time you mention Deus Ex, someone will reinstall it\"", but this is complete bullocks because no one in their right mind would ever uninstall it; it is the best 700mb on their hard drive! The point being, this is easily the best PC game, if not the best overall game, ever made. It is really quite sad how no game has ever been able to match it after 14 years in terms of complexity and competency.What a shame...""}]"

Mass Effect provides a deep and immersive storyline where every one of your actions changes the outcome of the game (as well as changing how the sequels play).You will also experience a fair share of Drama, Politics and Religion.In Mass Effect you will also rally companions of several different races each with different backgrounds. These companions each carry a unique unforgettable personality forcing the you to consider their opinions in every action you undertake.In addition, there is a vast and rich universe to discover which will provide you with at LEAST 20 hours of solid gameplay where at the end, you are left with a strong feeling of satisfaction (Not many games nowadays achieve this) and an overwhelming desire to play the sequels.""}]"

Hopefully with the new user experience finally getting some major TLC this is going to make the whole process much more intuitive. The most striking thing to me, was how little damage the initial set of weapons do, and how few useful mods drop early on, I got through the opening missions on Mercury with others, my experience on these levels aided that, but the step up to Venus was horrendous, the osprey shields made trying to kill anything a chore. I was forced to go back and repeatedly run missions to rank up the mods I had managed to collect.However once you break through and get to Earth, this is when the game truly shines, better mods drop which made the whole game seem more palatable. The graceful movement within game is beautiful, the addition of melee 2.0 has added a whole new dimension to the game, making melee both viable and more importantly fun. It is worth the effort to perservere and to get fully acquainted with the mechanics of the game, it opens up a world of possibilities, the continual development is widening the scope of gameplay with each update. Definitely recommend accruingmajor game time.""}]"

The choices you make and the lessons you take can turn your road to coronation to a sadly short life. Each death you have you looking at what you did wrong and how you faltered in your classes. The real strategy of this game comes from taking advantage of your moods to get the most out of your lessons.

These impact how long you can run and swim, of course, but also impact how well you handle recoil, climbing speed, take-off and landing in planes and helicopters, and so much more. If you want to bump up your flying skills, logic follows that you head to flight school.

What a difference five and a half years makes! Gone is the drab and depressing color scheme, giving players all the bright faux-California sun they can stand. Having lived in Los Angeles, many places in the world of Los Santos, San Andreas are familiar. The city itself is teeming with life, and I don\u2019t just mean random pedestrians and cars roaming around. People go about their daily lives: traffic backs up, downtown is busy, Vinewood is full of shopping and mansions, Vespucci Beach has people skating and lifting weights, Blaine County is far more rural with rednecks and pink flamingos, and wind turbines spin in the distance like the real-world San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm.

But even so, there is a great amount of work that has gone into the game play and construction side of it. Apart from the rare dropping through a map element, everthing seems firm, and real.The Beginnings...The premise is simple. You need to use \""cubes\"" to build a \""vehicle\"" (or \""robo\""), stick one of three types of weapons on, in or under it.. and then the fun begins!BattleSo far, it's cap the point. (I've seen requests for Death Match though.) You get teleported into a map which has your base (Blue) at one end, and Red's base at the other end. The map is set on other planets. What I have seen to date basically consists of barren wastelands. Dirt or Snow/Ice etc. The maps are well crafted and they allow for plenty of natural cover.As the aim is to either remove your opposition, or cap the point, you have a variety of options in your bot builds - depending on how you feel & how you play.CubesThe Cubes range from everything from low weight / low armour cubes, to armoured helium filled cubes, to aerofoils, to hover blades, to radar, and of course - weapons.WeaponsYou have three choices at the present time. SMGs. ie: \""Lasers\"", Plasma launchers, and Railguns.Each of these have different play styles to make them work, and each of them have their own weaknesses. (For example, Railguns have a huge recharge time, while SMGs have a short one. (putting plasmas in the middle)Upgrades and Tech researchWhat I found confusing at first was the Tier system for bots. When you build a bot, the quantity and the type of cubes that you incorporate give your robo a rating, or a tier placing. Based on that, you will fight simillarly tiered foe. You need to research your tech to allow for higher rated cubes. And for that, you get a set of points (the name of which escapes me at the moment). Further to this, you also get Repair Points (RP) to allow you to purchase new cubes to then fit on your craft.(It's a lot to take in and process / reconcile here, but it makes contextual sense in the game after a while.)Your RobosYou have the option of making anything you want. Any shape you want. As many weapons as you want. As fast / slow as you want... Provided it's either on wheels, hovers a few (game relative) meters above the ground, or flys.There are lots of crazy and awe inspiring designs around.Final WordsI really like this game, it's bumped out my mainstay game-of-choice to basically non-existance since I downloaded it. So, I give this 8.5 of 10 cubes.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted May 4."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited May 6."", ""item_id"": ""407840"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""The Review: PreludeMy friend Jacko has reminded me that this game is early access, and cost me a whopping 99 cents AuD.The ReviewIf you have read my review of this game in the last few days, it was a do not recommend, with some frustration strewn throughout. However, I have now replayed it with controls set up in a way that actually works. Now this review is happily a recommend :) although, there is a way to go, the bulk of the game is there, and appears to be solid enough. Oh, and may I also recommend that you start playing as an Assult class. It is a simple class, and one that gets you a feel for the game nicely.The backgroundI played Orion: Prelude, and when this came out - BAM insta-buy. I finally get around to trying it, and it's no longer First Person view. :( This may not be a deal breaker for you, but that's what I love playing. (I've been informed below that in version 1.5, FPV is back!)The GameThere are two modes of view. Top down third person, and over the shoulder third person. (And the v1.5 First Person)Things I like:Looks quite nice. (GTX 750 Ti)The harvester has a sense of humour! :DThere appears to be a lot of work gone into the tech/upgrade tree. Hopefully this will allow for diverse / specialised set ups for people.Now that I have proceeded past the initial shock of the change of view. I can see why Jacko (again) said that he really enjoyed his first play, and made friends. He's pretty easy to get along with when you first meet - so that's a good sign. :) I'm yet to delve into the online version of this, as my time was short.Things I don't like:The jump binding is conveniently called \""Roll\"". (dual purpose - In actual fact, the whole control system seems to very geared towards handheld controllers.)The game takes a while to load, but shows no indication that it is indeed loading. In fact, it doesn't even show up on the taskbar - making me think, each time, that it's frozen. (Intel Core i5-4690 2.5GHz / 16GB RAM / Win 10)The character that is \""you\"" seems disconnected from the world. That is to say, that the world could be projected onto a wall, and \""you\"" just dance around in front of it. (For over the shoulder view)The action of the grenade throw, and the actual grenade movement is lame. Needs work. (\""early access\"")Certain characters (ie: Assault) insist upon saying \""look at me go\"" every time you use the jetpack. Not a major gripe, but I hope in the final release it gives that a break from 100% of the time.Discoveries:F1 Key switches between views. (Thanks Jacko)Despite you view not being First Person (out of the visor), the world around you seems to move with your characters breathing. And as I wrote above, and you'll read in the comments, in version 1.5, true first person view will be back.I can't tell if it's my underspec'd character, or that the jump / boost ceiling is very low. But getting around up high is very hard.If you do manage to get up above the ground, only the dino flyers even attempt to get you. Most ground dinos become confused, and don't necessarily even attempt their primary destructive objective.There are Hats - TF2, oh how you've changed the world.There are drops and chests to be found.Dem FeelsMy initial feelings about this game was that I didn't get it. I got the Prelude, but this one... Now that I have rejiggerd the controls, and played it again on a simpler class - I had more of an affinity for it. So I'm happier now.The End BitI'm sure more things will come to light as I play this in multiplayer mode. And I'm glad I gave this game another chance. I look forward to seeing where the devs take this.Thanks to Jacko, Neomeinx and Cjnfl for helping me with this review.""}]"

I purchased Wolf Among Us because I loved the first season of The Walking Dead (TWD) by Telltale Games and somehow, Telltale have managed to surpass what they portrayed so perfectly in TWD. The story, characters, art style, soundtrack, decisions and gameplay mechanics are all vastly improved in Wolf Among Us. The story of The Wolf Among Us reolves around the character known as Bigby who is the detective of Fabletown and is the Big Bad Wolf Fable character. Bigby is on the case to solve the mystery of a certain Fable's death (Spoilers). This leads you to meet a ton of fascinating Fable characters in Fabletown like Snow White, Woodsman, Toad, etc. Every single Fable character you run into is fascinating to listen to and Telltale go the extra mile by having a character profile for every Fable character if you're interested in the lore of the universe. The art style is gorgeous, it has this handdrawn vibrant noir style that looks beautiful in all scenarios, especially outside Fabletown in the colorful areas. The soundtrack suits the games themes of mystery, hopelessness and noir perfectly, there's a soundtrack for every moment, whether it's action, detective scenarios or depression, Bigby's Apartment theme is a favourite of mine. Considering this is a Telltale game, it's still a point and click adventure game just like all their games and the gameplay isn't exactly what you would call, \""fun\"", but it's not supposed to be, it's supposed to be a game that makes you think, question your morality, your choices, who you trust, what you say, where to go, etc. Every decision you make affects the outcome of the story, the characters you meet and the detective case at hand and that's what makes the game so enjoyable to play. Without a doubt, Wolf Among Us is one of my favourite games of all time, Telltale have done it again and I can't recommend this game enough, especially with all 5 episodes now released, it's a must buy.10/10""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted June 28, 2014."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""107100"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Bastion is easily one of the best Indepdent games ever made and is one of my favourite games of all time.

It will take you around 6 - 8 hours to complete the main campaign but there are side activites you can complete to level up your character, weapons and to buy items like Vigils, Spirits and Abilities at the store and more. The only negative of Bastion for me was that the story was confusing to understand and follow at times, but it is still an engaging narrative and is told beautifully by the \""Old man\"" narrator.

Admittedly I've always enjoyed the Warhammer universe, turned based games and fantasy so I'm getting a little something extra there. There's a good selection of playable characters and quests to be completed and while some of the quests feel a bit samey there's enough of a story line going on and variety that, for me, it didn't become too annoying (that said there *are* a lot of quests too!). There's plenty of loot and booty to be had and I'd recommend holding off on purchasing weapons in some of the many towns you will come across because levelling up your characters in the latter stages of the game can become pricey and I found that I had a backlog of characters needing to be trained. I discovered that a lot of the quest reward weapons and random drops had me kitted out pretty well anyway. The game quests are designed to played through in a short period of time, about a half-dozen to a dozen rooms in total. Any of the general quests in the wilderness will likely only take a half hour or so if you don't find yourself getting into trouble and the story-line quests will take a little longer. While there's no form of permadeath nor any major punishment when your adventures die it can be annoying when your whole party wipes-out in a dungeon because you get swamped by monsters because of random spawns during combat. The vampires tend to be just as powerful, if not more powerful, than you so you really need to get your strategy right. Don't give up though as when all looks lost you can steal victory from the jaws of defeat (and only by the skin of your teeth) and that when I enjoyed the game the most. The only major annoyance and criticism I have is that some of the game mechanics (e.g. those pesky vampires and random spawns) could have used a little more testing and tweaking as occasionally it's a little unfair in its imbalance. I was fighting a Vampire Lord and just when I had his accompanying retinue sorted and about end his undead Lordliness another vampire spawned, around the corner and well out of my reach, and proceeded to heal, disable and resurrect until I was completely surrounded and outnumbered four to one. Slowly but surely my brave adventurers met a grizzly end. Frustrating but, like I said, no major penalty incurred (but man it sucks at the final stage of the dungeon). Well, more critters to be stuck with my blade. If you enjoy Warhammer and enjoy turn base roll playing then I certainly recommend WQ and also a simple introduction to the genre.""}]"

I'm just going to get that out the way first up since I don't really know how to review this without spoiling EVERYTHING. And this is a game that NEEDS to be played blind. With all the jokes and story points it will not be as great of an experience if ANYTHING is spoiled for you, except for the secrets, maybe. Alright. Time for the ACTUAL review. Let's start with the soundtrack, since it can be described in one word: PERFECTHonestly, this is the best soundtrack I have ever heard. I love the use of both chiptune and real (recorded samples, maybe) instruments. Every song is superb and has its own place. If you were to ask me what my favourite track from the game is, I wouldn't be able to tell you. The graphics are very nice, reminiscent of consoles such as the Commodore 64 all the way to the Game Boy Advanced (Skipping one or two), and something else... (Not telling because it would spoil it, somewhat). They don't add or subtract anything (Except one part. You'll know what it is) but were worth mentioning anyway.The story has got to be the defining factor for this game. Without as great a story as this, the game would probably be a \""good\"" instead of \""OMG IT'S THE BEST GAME EVER\"" (Sorry). It isn't one of those games where the story is incredibly rich at the very beginning. It actually starts with a very small story that could be put into a 1980s NES game. However, the more you play, the more you explore and the more you want to find, you more you will find. There are just so many details that all correlate with each other. I can't really say anymore without spoiling some of the game, so you'll just have to trust me on this one. The gameplay is quite fun as well. Instead of having turns that bounce back between the player and the opponent, like a traditional JRPG, The player attacks with a simple QTE and dodges the enemy attacks like a Shoot em up. It's a very interesting and fun twist on the old way of battling. Undertale is easily my Game of the Year and possibly my favourite game EVER. (It's still contending with Terraria for the number one spot). Even though it isn't a game you can play over and over and over again, the quality of this game absolutely outstanding. So good job Toby Fox for making this brilliant game, and making me spend half an hour on a review. Final Score - 10.000000001/10(Someone will get that)TL;DR: IS BEST GAME GO BUY NOW!""}]"

The fact that sometimes your road will be suddenly blocked by a tiny bit of hill was frustrating. Also, the visuals are a little dull. For me it became a little boring after several city starts.

I have to say I may not be the greatest gamer but there really needs to be a difficulty above Helldive, as I have soloed and have seen many others solo Helldives this being the hardest difficulty you can get in there planet difficulty rating short of a boss battle (there is only a few of those) it leave you wanting something more.

It feels very much like it was developed for tablets only.The game pace is terrible slow. Most of the time you will just sit around and waiting for the pink bubbles (your mana points, which allow you to do things like terra forming etc.) to pop up above each of your settlements, which you then have to collect by clicking on them. Let me repeat that: if you have 200 settlements, you have to click 200 different pink bubbles to collect your \""mana points\"" and progress in the game. So most of the time you end up just sitting around doing nothing and just wait for the next bubbles to click on, which is as much fun as watching paint dry - except that paint will dry much faster than this game progresses. It's just a huge disapointment for me. Save your money or pick up the original Populus on GOG instead.""}]"

Seeing Geralt's figure disappear in his horse every time there's a cinematic moment, or seing your persona walk through a collumn mid conversation or others pass through you as if you were a ghost - feels a lot like Gothic which came out many MANY years ago.(especially irritating if you pre-ordered) This, mind you is not the most irritating of those and certainly not the most persistent - there are quests I could not finish because the NPC ignored the \""talk\"" function, a couple of stuck loading screens after killing a monster from a contract list, bald figures with hair and clothing rendered a few seconds after close-up, and the somewhat weird duck-and-roll technique which will get you up any mountain.As far as graphics go - It looks very good though at times one cannot but wonder if it couldn't look better.

The port itself is quite good. Not perfect, but it has been perfectly functional for me.Graphics options are limited, though you can uncap the framerate and enable/disable vsync. MSAA at varying levels is your only antialiasing option. The textures are noticably aged, but are fine for a game that's a decade old. Hopefully some mods can provide some higher resolution textures. Sound works fine most of the time, though some audio samples are of varying quality. I think this may have been the original quality though, not an issue with the port.The game performance is good, with stable framerates when running around grabbing stuff. Hitting a big cluster of zombies with a big object may cause a lag spike, however it is very brief. Loading times are monumentally improved compared to the original.The game itself is a joy to play. It is simplistic compared to DR2 and beyond, but I prefer this. No running around for money like a neurotic Hebrew; no overpowered combo weapons from \""Wrestlemania meets backyard warriors;\"" just you, a mall and a big bunch of zombies in your way with some believable psychopaths for you to overcome. The game is more serious compared to the other games, though it can be goofy if you choose to dress up and use silly items. This humour contrasts nicely against the gravity of the situation, which can make it all the funnier.

Running around finding things to essentially duct-tape together weapons is a great mechanic, and executed quite well. Extend this to the creation of new vehicles, ala rollerhog; a motorcycle with a steamroller drum on the front.. oh and some flamethrowers to boot.. and you've got a recipie for a lot of zomb-hem. Zomb..saster? Zombtato?There are a few things that bug me, the worst probably being the occasional inability to pick up what you actually want despite looking directly at it. Turn your stance a bit and the item highlights.. but hey, your character wants to do a full 90 degree turn, not just 45 degrees, so again you lose the highlight and can't pick up the item.. or worse yet you pick up a cardboard box instead of an assault rifle. Some of the travel missions are a pain in the butt, sending you to all four corners of the city,. On the upside, big missions tend to have bigger rewards, but a few times I felt like I'd wasted a heap of effort. There was also a single boss mechanic which just didnt seem to work well, though I had no trouble getting through it; I still felt like it hadnt been played out the way the designers intended. Hmm.. I might watch the video on that one to see how it was meant to go down.I see a lot of potential in the co-op system, though ended up turning it off myself as the first person who jumped in was an internet-tard and decided to start swearing because I wasnt on a mic. Thankfully you can change the co-op mode at any time. I would probably play through this with a friend in co-op mode.I rate this at least three potatoes out of an unknown amount, it was very playable and had so many sweet combos and a decent player upgrade system. I rarely got stuck on missions and smaller simpler missions didnt make you work too hard, with the components for completion reasonably easy to find. Do keep in mind that some areas will be locked until further down the track, so don't try for too long to get a blueprint or collectable if it seems like you shouldn't be in the area just yet. I have seen a bunch of stuff on the net about people who couldnt play this with nvidia graphics - i'm running a radeon so I guess not much problem there for me, though might be worth researching just in case.""}]"

The story is great thus far and there's plenty of side quests and other little goodies to keep you occupied from even the main story, as completing them will get you rare items like armor parts and weapons with better mods on them. The perk system is great and gives ease of access to the character type you wanna run, my current build is a melee/pistol stealthy \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 that dispatches a lot of unaware enemies, though I won't leave out that sneak mode is still pretty fickle and broken a lot of the time.There's a good number of companions, though unlike New Vegas allowing you to run with 2, you are only allowed to have one with you at all times, a small draw back, but it makes it easier, still careful since you companion can sometime kinda pull you into conversations in the midst of combat which makes for humorous moments or they kinda \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you over in trying to disarm traps and just walk right into them, otherwise, gathering them is worth your time because most of them have a great sense of charm and you'll easily become attached to a few of them.The change to the Power Armor mechanics as it to being more akin to a knight set over your normal wears without it on can make all the difference in some battles with what you decide to tackle head out and can be helpful to help you collect junk in the wasteland to mod weapon parts, armor parts, settlements and other things such as repairs to the armor itself.There ARE side quests, you just have to look out for them, can't really miss them, you get pretty good loot and benefits for your labor to completing them.You'll level up pretty fast in this game verus the other Fallouts, which can seemingly take forever, forcing you mostly to complete quests just to level up most of the time compared to grinding, which makes since, Fallout is not a grind heavy game compared to a game like Monster Hunter is. And with leveling up faster having no level caps like the other Fallout does, the leveling system is far better beyond compare as FO 3/NV, the cap was LV 30 if you didn't have DLC, which only brought the cap up to LV 50, making it a bit more punishing on try to get the right build you want to run with.The settlement/building system was a mod in pervious Fallout games, like NV that people made, Bethseda has added such a system to bring that very idea to this game and it's great, because now the junk in the wasteland suddenly no longer becomes junk, it's junk you need to support your settlements to keep them supplied and well defended.Overall, Bethseda did a great job with this game, it's a great game and despite the few flaws and bugs, which can easily be fixed via performance issues. you can easily look past all of it. If your a fan of Fallout, get this game, it capitalize on a lot the other vanilla Fallouts didn't have unless you had mods added to them.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted July 23, 2014."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""250760"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""JUSTICE IN SPADES, BRETHERN!!!

If you need anything make a post on the forums and I'll probably be there.The upperpart of my review is of the game below that I will address the points of some of the negative reviews.Darkest Dungeon is fairly straightforward, multiple heroes with varying skills and abilities that you send off to a dark lovecraftian dungeon to fend off creatures battling to keep your health, hunger and sanity in check. In a sense it plays a little like an old Final Fantasy game, but without any pheonix downs and every monster matters.There are four seperate dungeons (and then the end game dungeon) that each have their own unique strengths and weaknesses and thus who you send into each area is often unique. As you select your four heroes you need to make some tough decisions. Will you send the Plague doctor? The only hero to boast both a double stun and double poison skill. The Bounty Hunter who can uppercut your enemies into different ranks? Or a mighty Man at Arms who can guard another while boosting his own defense and then next round can activate a counter attack! Rather than just a simple \""Me am warrior me am stronk!\"" teams who can work together and take out the nasty healers and stress dealers, who hide in the back rank, fast and first will leave the dungeon sane while the slow teams with very little reach into the back rows will teem with madness and disease.Darkest Dungeon features a fairly linear weapon and armor system (coupled with some reasonable D&D type factors in how speed and other mechanics work) but offers a unique trinket system that can spice up combat. A disease and quirk system, diseases are obviously bad while quirks come in good and bad qualities.The final piece is the stress system, while dungeoneering your Heroes will gain stress through various means, will they crack under pressure? Or will they stand steady as a beacon of hope?In its entirety the game offers a well known system but adds several unique mechanics to really make it stand out.I would highly recommend anyone interested in this game but still unsure to watch some playthroughs on youtube.Also, check out some of the reviews with large comment chains and you'll see downvoters calling upvoters \""shills\"". They're absolutely paranoid that people can like this game. It's pretty funny.For a while I thought this game was too hard, that I was doing everything right and that RNG was screwing me over.Then I got gud and realized that I had everything wrong. It is tough and RNG will kick you while you're down but many of these downvotes are blatant lies and I would like to address them here.\""You lose 10-20 hours per character that dies\"" I have lost about 4 max rank characters, and a few rank 3-4 ones aswell, at time of posting this I have 88 hours gameplay. My roster is almost full of max rank characters and I beat the game. The roster has 28 slots (+12 due to end game reasons), by his/her maths I'd need about 400-800 hours to do that.\""I was 1-hit by a non crit\"" utter lies. Maybe, just maybe, they had a plague doctor in the front row with double -HP trinkets... but why have some one who is essentially protected by a tissue and as weak as a kitten in that situation and then act like it's not your fault when a GIANT hits you?Many, many of the complaints are \""I don't have a good team set up and I can't hit some one at the back!\"" Well that's probably their fault for bringing three units who can only hit the front two ranks and a healer.Several complaints are that the characters aren't equally powered and some outshine others, but I 100% believe the characters are extremely well balaned - it's all about using the characters correctly. For example the Plague Doctor isn't supposed to deal damage like a crusader/leper or heal HP like a Vestal, but a support class that can stun and poison (even two people at once) and stop heavy bleed/poison damage. Many - if not most - the complaints come from an update that causes stops enemies at the back from instantly moving forward when you kill a front unit. So rather than an open varied team they get upset their insanely powerful double leper set up (that guy 100% strongest solo character) can't just one hit everything.I have felt their pain but I can gaurantee that many of the complaints are biased and just frustrated that they couldn't get it right - even the forums get \""I attacked Wilbur and my characters said 'No don't do that you're upsetting the big one' and then the big one got angry WTF RNG I AM LEET PRO\"" (youtube darkest dungeons wilbur fails).I am not saying that their reviews are without merit, but the devolopers have made leaps and bounds to meet in the middle.Now you can hire higher leveled heroes, bonus XP under certain conditions and some units bring resources for dungeons and even a new class that adds some risk V reward.And if all else fails, ask for help on the forums. I sure have, the people there are (mostly) friendly and are willing to help.I have yet to find a bug or skill working improperly.If you find flaw within my review (and my review of negative reviews) please feel free to criticize or offer advice.""}, {""funny"": ""1 person found this review funny"", ""posted"": ""Posted December 7, 2015."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited March 19."", ""item_id"": ""299480"", ""helpful"": ""13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""I think the fact that most of the positive comments come from people with less than 10 hours, some less than four hours, show that this game just isn't really worth it.As for everyone downvoting this, check out all those below one hour gameplay good reviews, there's like three over 10 hours.

I think you can turn it off, but it's still a head ache and then just becomes earily quiet as you listen to the great advance of... nothing.The AI is painful.Being shot at by cannons? Your crew will visit the roof. Raining that causes morale to drop? Roof visits for everybody! I just wish I could tell them to sit down a little easier.Or the guy with a fishing rod must stand on the right most corner block at the highest height possible, on the side you get attacked on. Why can't I tell him to stand on the good, safe, side?And all that fish... useless, everyone just dies of scurvy and refuses to eat the fruit you have so you just go out for excess fruit and never bother fishing.There are some things that people can use to increase stats/XP gain but they kept leaving to go do other things, I just want them to stay where I told them.I had 15 chickens constantly leaving fecal matter, I had their cages and I kept them until they leveled enough to lay eggs. I still have the two eggs that they laid (and I had them for several hours). After those two they refused to do anything.As far as teaching them skills, you almost always need cleaning because there is so much filth everywhere, swimming because insta-death sucks and before you know it almost everyone is practically a clone with skills that aren't so much choices but needs.I even spent 15 minutes not knowing why a ship of mine wasn't considered sea worthy just because I had a piece of backdrop in a place that they couldn't reach. The backdrop doesn't actually do anything besides look pretty, imagine your pirate ship not being allowed out because of a colour you chose. And the 'problem indicator' just showed the highest right-most block rather than showing me the problem.The weapons are either great or useless with little in-between. Through use or stones you can level them, either level 10, 25 or 50. But for so, so many weapons it's a useless waste of time or if it is useful a grind. Many have effects that aren't really useful because the weapon sucks. Weapons from stores also seem to display incorrect info? (Stores also sometimes don't display the in depth item info such as damage/DPS/stats/etc on certain items).The fights are just your guys rushing them, healing is a bit of a pain.And to travel from one place to the other you have to wait for your characters to get there, you can increase their speed with items but it is so tedious especially the first hour or so since you can't go too far from town or else risk running out of provisions.All in all the start to mid game was nice with none of these problems being that bad but as the game went on it stopped being fun to play.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted December 18, 2014."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""227680"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""It had potential but fails to deliver.

There is a lot of history filled into this game, like the legendary battles fought in war of the roses (well this game is called war of the roses so what do you expect) and all that so you will learn a lot about how it was back then when they had battles and sometimes at loading screens they tell you a bit about the map your about to play on.But focusing on the game, the graphics, game play quality and all that is really good, but at times you might run across a bug or too but it rarely happens. The game is fluid and addictive, the fighting takes a little time to get use to but once you get a hang of it you will be just slashing through other people.

Working up towards building a big fleet is incredibly satisfying, as you build up your techs and number of ships per fleet, how far they can go, what weapons and armour they have. Not to mention the DESIGNER. Oh man. Sure, they have a (quite a large) finite number of blocks you can use per faction, but the ways you can COMBINE them is infinite. Honestly. You could easily build a ship out of any one block type, as each block comes in a certain style and appearance that can be shrunk/expanded/rotated/moved/even ANIMATED (ie moving parts), you can easily design unique ships that you're not likely to see made by anyone else.Please play this game with me.

Borderlands attempts to create something vivid, interesting, with a somewhat low-def touch - The Long Dark *could* fall into the same category. This game is definitely not striving to achieve the *best* graphics out there, but I found it to be just as likeable.Edit: Really looking forward to extra updates from the developers.

I plan on playing on hard and eventually nightmare. There are additions to the game that would have been welcomed but all in all it was a good game. I personally would of loved a \""respec\"" feature. Reading a description of a skill/talent is different than using it in combat. Just my .02 USD.I would appreciate a \""story\"" mode, but it would not be a deal breaker for me playing the game. A suggestion if possible is auto resolve battles like Rome Total War. I know they are not the same thing. But it was the first example I had in my head. Like crunch the numbers of the current heroes versus the current enemies and get a prediction of who would win. Then decide to fight it out or CPU resolve it for time-saving.I liked the isometric map. It made the game more immersive. I liked having some freedom to pursue my quest completion. I think many people are comparing this game to Loren The Princess of the Amazon. I see that as fair but not accurate. These are two different games with two different scopes and scales of the world of Aravorn. The scope SOTW is magnified and the game is epic for different reasons. The fighting was different than Loren, but it was a small learning curve for any RPG veteran to overcome.I didn't know there were over 100 battles in the game. I guess people played this game for different reasons. I played it to flesh out the romances and was captivated by the humor. The story was palpable due to the great writing and art. I can see why people can be turned off from this game due to the number of battles.""}]"

It is the fifth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and a direct sequel to 2011's Assassin's Creed: Revelations. The game was released worldwide for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, beginning in North America on October 30, 2012, with a Wii U and Microsoft Windows release following in November 2012.The plot is set in a fictional history of real world events and follows the centuries old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the Templars, who desire peace through control. The framing story is set in the 21st century and features series protagonist Desmond Miles who, with the aid of a machine known as the Animus, relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the 2012 apocalypse. The story proper is set in the 18th century, before, during and after the American Revolution from 1753 to 1783, and follows Desmond's half-English, half-Mohawk ancestor, Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton, also known as Connor, as he fights the Templars' attempts to gain control of the newly forming nation.Assassin's Creed III is set in an open world and presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on using Desmond and Connor's combat and stealth abilities to eliminate targets and explore the environment. Connor is able to freely explore 18th-century Boston, New York and the American frontier to complete side missions away from the primary storyline. The game also features a multiplayer component, allowing players to compete online to complete solo and team based objectives including assassinations and evading pursuers. Ubisoft developed a new game engine, Anvil Next, for the game. The game was met with positive reviews and has sold 12 million copies worldwide.A continuation of the series, entitled Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, was announced in early 2013, and is set to follow Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton's grandfather - Edward Kenway - a pirate and Assassin operating in the Caribbean.""}]"

This is balanced though with the option of stealthier play, going for a special-ops approach by sniping rim targets before dispatching with silenced SMG's, or perhaps opting for the full commando approach of bow and blade for silent and endlessly satisfying close up take-downs.When it does come to the combat, this is what makes the game shine; the freedom of choice and random environmental events that can make any replay completely individual. You can experiment with techniques and combinations that suit you and the situation until you hit your sweet spot, which for me is dispatching entire battalions without any of them seeing me coming, basically being Batman with camo paint.In regards to the adventure and story of the game, it's well written, thought provoking and at times legitimately scary in regards to the greatest evil out there; Ourselves. Delving into some beautiful psychological territory and being able to successfully portray their mentalities is what makes the characters of this game so engrossing and real. The character of Vaas is honestly the best portrayed character's i've encountered so far, the voice actor is brilliant, the animation and mannerisms support him so well you can't help but love him...you know, as much as you can love that sort of person.Admittedly the QTE's do cut into the freedom of the gameplay when it comes to 'boss fights' but it does allow for expression of the protagonist...it wouldn't be as insightful if you just popped them off from 100 yards and had a monologue explain how you felt about it. So as much as I don't like QTE's, these seem pretty  justified.Next is the environment, which is another of this game's strong points in all honestly. The 'world' is not vast but it isn't small either, and it really depends on how you choose to tackle it. Fast travel points allow you to quickly cross the map but you will miss out on all that randomly generated wildlife and firefighting, so depending on if you want to burn through the missions or really get right into the jungle, you're play-through will be quite different. I've included crafting, hunting and platforming missions in this section just to separate it from combat and narrative; the crafting is pretty fantastic, in that it's firstly a sort of tutorial for dealing with enemies without the risk of ranged damage, but if you are foolish enough to let most predators get close, especially in the early game, you're not going to live very long. This is so much more exciting than shooting at glorified paddlepop sticks and having a voice-over pat you incessantly for performing actions a child could accomplish. On the other point, platforming in this game can be repetitive at times but it's still always exciting, the slip and panic animations when you just make a ledge often causes a tight gripping of the mouse in response. The rewards at the end of these episodes are often worthwhile and you'll rarely feel cheated for that 5 minutes of leaping, ducking, climbing and diving.Possibly the biggest letdown to this game would be the multiplayer aspect. The lobbying can be aggravating and there isn't a large enough population on the servers to justify it being anywhere on par to other AAA FPS games. The Co-Op can be really fun and adds a whole new story to the world of FarCry, but as with the game as a whole, you'll need a PC that can handle it's graphic demands.Overall this game is a truly visceral and engaging experience if you can take on the character, if you can step into his shoes and let yourself live his story, you're gonna have a fantastic time. Be warned it's not for the fragile, there's a lot of gore, some nudity, drug references and references to social issues that you might not agree with, but they are used to engage and expand the characters for the most part.Game in a line:Wouldn't recommend to time-poor gamers, best played in-depth and with a willingness to be absorbed, after which will be a game nigh unforgettable.Get Into The Jungle!""}]"

THERE IS NO CONTROL REBINDING! that is right a full launch of a game that does not let you edit the controls. Really?2. The Infinate vault hopping thing. there are so many vids on youtube and times that i have spent waisting time with a survivor that will just hop through window after window after window. 3. Perk Ballance in relation to the lvl of others in the loby. how many times i have come across a high lvl Meg with Adrenaline, seriously that perk is so OP it is not funny, full heal and run speed +150%, at it's best it will full heal from dying state... are you serious? AND after she gets to lvl 30, she can teach it to other survivors.On the flip side lets look at a few killer perks, Insidious for example, after standing still for a few seconds you have no terror effect, or no heart beat to hear, untill you move or act again.Dearstalker, the ability to see aura of dying survivours from a distance awayAnd Iron Grasp which makes it tougher for a survivor to escape from you holding them.These are, in my opinion the best 3 perks that the killers have.If you are going to buy this game, be sure you have 4 friends to play with as this is currently the best way to get enjoyment out of this game. Ther is serious Potential in this game, and i want to see it brought into being, and that is why i bought it...

Really fun and there is a lot to do in the game that makes you want to continue to play. There are unlockables like Perks, Offerings, Clothes, Items, Addons etc. You can level up your characters as well as your rank for both Survivor and Killer.You can also play private matches with your friends and you won't lose anything if you do die as a survivor.The ranking system in my opinion is good enough for now; you collect these crystals (at least they look like crystals) called PIPS, according to the official Dead By Daylight Manual, and when you collect a certain amount in a row,  you get promoted. The lowest rank in the game is 20 and the highest rank is 1. To get from rank 20-19 you must collect 3 pips. From Rank 12 and onwards, you must collect 5 pips each rank down, meaning Rank 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 require 5 pips each before you get to Rank 1 for both Survivor and Killer.So the game seems cool, right? Well, most games aren't that perfect...TLDR: Great Game, Fun, Lost of Unlockables, makes you want to continue playing, Private Matches, Ranking System, Collect Pips to Rank Up, Rank 20 lowest rank, Rank 1 Highest Rank.NEGATIVESThe only way to rank up in the game is to play public matches, and this makes it difficult because people try and find their friends so they search and quit lobbies until they find them because you currently CANNOT invite your friends to public matches, only private matches, and some players just boost each other. For example one person plays as the killer, hosting the lobby and the other playing as a survivor, and they troll you. There are many disadvantages in the game too, such as:- The host of every game is the killer. This is bad because almost every killer in the game has a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 ISP.- Everybody is searching for their friends, and sometimes it can take a while to find a game. The longest it took me to once find a game was 1 hour for this reason...- You will lag in almost EVERY game.- You WILL rage.- You WILL die in stupid ways.- You WILL get stuck in objects.- There are HACKERS in this game too!Now it's time to elaborate on these points. The killer being the host of every game really annoys me, just because it gives them a huge advantage. Think of it like this; The host controls everything, and you and your friends are normal people doing normal stuff. But the host has \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 internet, and because he controls everything, it affects you and your friends WAY more than it does for him. As a matter of fact, it doesn't affect him at all. LAG will ruin you, and make you rage. I've lost many games just because of lag. But how does the lag affect you in game? Well, when you attempt to vault over something, like a wall or object, and you're lagging, you are going to die, especially if the killer's chasing you, because what happens is that rather than vaulting, your character FREEZES. Lag also makes you teleport literally everywhere and will get you killed. This is why you will rage and die in the most stupidest ways.You will also get stuck in objects. One time I spawned into a game (The developers call these TRIALS) and I was repairing a generator. Then the killer was coming towards me and I was thinking, \""Oh no problem, I will just hide behind this tree.\"" So I go behind 'This tree' and crouch and he walks past me. \""Yeh I'm all good.\"" I think to myself. Then I go to walk away from the tree and then just like that, I was stuck. I literally couldn't move, and the murderer was coming back. He walked past me again and didn't see me. Although he didn't see me, I was still very angry, because I wasn't going to be able to survive unless I get him to kill me. So I just quit and also got demoted and lost my item. This is why the Killer has such a HUGE advantage in the game. This also isn't the only object I've gotten stuck into.I have recorded games I've played where my connection with the Killer was very bad, and I will perhaps upload them soon to my Steam profile/YouTube channel (Link on Profile!). So be sure to check those out if you would like to see more on what I'm talking about.Last but not least, hackers, yes, there are hackers already... And the game was only recently released, EVEN with an ANTI-CHEAT! This just really confuses me as to why their anti-cheat software hasn't even banned these players yet. I saw a player who had prestiged his Claudette Morel to level 1000, which at this stage, is an impossible stage to even be on. Most players, almost all, haven't even prestiged, including myself. TLDR: Game has more negatives than positives. ConclusionSo to conclude my review, this game needs more development. The game is great and fun, but when you take the negatives into account, Dead By Daylight isn't really the best game to buy at this time. I believe the developers didn't give enough time on their project and should have continued developing the game and released it at a later date. But the developers are still working on patches and have apparently said they wil be allowing people to invite their friends to public games instead of just private games. So to say they should be adding more patches as well. But in the meantime, I recommend you should save your money for the time being and wait till more patches come through.Thank you for reading my review!""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted December 7, 2015."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""252490"", ""helpful"": ""1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""Very Annoying.

Though I do not fervently pursue every inch and corner of this particular game. It arguably has proven itself a very difficult game to drop as a result of events and decent action.To speak about this game in more particular detail, you would not discover a game filled to the brinks with story and lore. You are a lone warrior of a long forgotten race under the order and jurisdiction of one particular woman who calls herself Lotus. The tutorial will give you a glimpse of the story until you are given your own ship, where the story boils down to sweet FA because except quests that gives you Warframes and event plot lines, all you would be left doing is finding more Warframes, weapons, blueprints, mods and materials so you can craft them, grind them and use them in your quest of discovering more Warframes, weapons, blueprints, mods and materials. You can also throw your own clan's development progress and the contributions you can make towards a game faction into it as well, adding more time to this particular grindfest.So why would I even recommend this game? Well, because the action doesn't disappoint, though the sweet satisfaction of completing and fully modifying and tricking out your weapons and Warframe of choice is mostly rewarded just by a greater statistical number, the complete and total decimation of your enemies is sure to bring a happy smile on any action genre enthusiasts, with bloodied and pretty gory corpses to boot (optional) as you can be sure you are the one that led to their complete and utter mutilation.The boss battle is usually hit or miss, with bosses that are simply bullet sponges to bosses that requires a little bit more finesse, like bosses that teleports and bosses who only intakes damage in certain areas, Normally, you wouldn't have any gripes with more difficult bosses, but when you are grinding for a specific part for something you want and the random number generator have forsaken you in dropping the loot you desire over and over, I think you would grow to hate such technicalities that serve no other purpose than stopping you from getting that sweet four barreled shotgun.There is currently a total of 23 Warframes available in-game, with harder, better, faster, stronger version of some frames available for grinding already, if there is a particular suit you like, you might just be able to grab a even spiffier version of it. Every suit does indeed come with 4 unique abilities of it's own and is highly customisable in terms of cosmetics and specific combat capabilities and parameters.  Every grindable gear, equipment or companion caps out at level 30, with 8 slots for mods (collectible cards that improve stats or utility in someway) each item total. There's more stuff out there then I would care to mention, but you'd find out if you play it no? Just know it probably means more grinding, better damages and maybe just your own personal pet dog, that and maybe space combat with you in a suit that can fly, but hey, I find that to be more of a gimmick in comparison to me pinning a wave of enemies under one powerful arrow, as their mid sections split, separating their body parts into two halves with their decapitated torsos nailed to the wall, all from just one well placed shot from my bow.You have three slots for weaponries, a primary slot for your power hungry dreams like snipers, assault rifles, shotguns or even bows. A secondary slot for that dual-wielding fantasy of yours, or maybe just having to use something because you ran out of primary ammo, we are talking dual revolvers, pistols, shurikens (ninja stars) and automatic repeaters. Lastly, what's a ninja without a melee weapon? Pick something traditional like a katana, a claymore or a long sword or go ham with electronic whips, wolverine claws and grim reaper scythes.Frankly, none of that will drag you into the game more than a mate and a growing clan that needs your attention because of all the exclusive weaponries in it, game factions because of their unique weapons and cosmetics. But more importantly, the timed events that will give you stronger versions of grindable mods and weapons, you can feel pretty left out with out those stuff, but then there is the free trade market in game that will let you grab those stuff you can't grind for anymore (at least for awhile) for real actual money, because there is always someone selling if you are patient enough.If someone tells you all of the stuff in this game is grindable, that isn't technically true, because there are certain things that haven't seen the light of day ever since a certain time period, you have event mods and weapons that are ungrindable outside of events, originally grindable stuff taking out of the maps they can be obtained from, stuff being retired from the game completely at certain points and if you really care for it, unique cosmetics that are sold in real money bundles.This is why I consider this game to be borderline addictive, you are forced to revisit this game from time to time because the game refuses to let you go with its consistent weapon, Warframe and event updates with stuff being retired, made rarer and exclusive by different varying circumstances.But then, neither will you let go of it completely, because you know that friend of yours is quite keen to see just how much damage that fully customised weapons of yours do and you'd be happy to oblige him.Other things I've neglected to mention:Potentially excellent graphics with a decent computer.Four man cooperation gameplay all around, with specific eight man maps out and some more in development.PVP.Clan Alliances and being able to take certain areas under your jurisdiction while being able to tax those who run missions on it.""}]"

With the morale if you see your men die in front of you your character gets shakey. Overall I think it is a really good game and I agree with the developers that COD has ruined a generation of shooters. For the price this game is well worth it.GET IT! RIGHT NOW!""}]"

This game is not bad, in the first few hours, it is amazing to see a small group can make a small game with some much fun staff in it. The reason I dont use word 'content' is simplely because it really doesnt provide many things to do in the game. As I said before, this game will amaze u in the first few hours, after that it starts getting shallow, empty, repetitive and boring. Abanden base looks almost the same, except in different colors. Environment look almost the same as you further explore in to the stars. NPCs and animals in the game gives me the feeling they came from spore, so far I only found 4 different high-intelligence species, there might be more, yet they only serve as a gift machine or shop, which I really wish there could be some short quest from different species. This game is marketed as Exploration of the infinite universe, but I think they kinda failed it, there are infinite stars but they share a little bit too much similarity. There are maybe infinite species, but their existence has no meaningful thing to the game except fill up the emptyness. I havent reach the planet with large city on it or with large alien species population, make me feels like there are surely infinite stars out there, but they are lifeless. Hopefully my furture explore will discover some more civilized planet, but for now I will not recommend this game, I will keep this updated.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted August 27."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""337000"", ""helpful"": ""3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""Deus Ex: Mankind Divided [CHAPTER 1] Microtransection Edition""}]"

It's not a bad game but I didn't find it particularly good either.The story is pretty basic, as least as far as I got. You, Generic Townsperson, were hanging out doing one day doing townsfolky things when your relative was tragically killled by Lord Evilguy and his evil followers, the Cult of Evil. You then gain magic powers and set out to kill Lord Evilguy and avenge your beloved <InsertRelativeNameHere>. There are a few other cutscenes along the way but they don't seem to tell us much we don't already know.Level design is also fairly straightforward - the entire game seems to be one long corridor with the occasional short sidepath, although it looks decent enough.The combat is clearly the meat of the game, but for me it just wasn't that interesting. A lot of people who like the game will claim that if someone doesn't like the combat, it's because they're \""doing it wrong\"" - they don't know how to combine spells properly and just throw the one fireball spell over and over. In my case I don't think that's true. I've seen the videos, I've read a couple of guides, I'm using the mastery and control spells, I'm using my blink and block, and I still dodn't find it terribly exciting.Generally, spells work best if you charge them up a bit, and it usually takes several spells to kill an enemy - at the very least, applying \""mastery\"" (which increases the power of subsequent hits) and/or a control spell before going for damage is normal. Combine with the fact that the game doesn't really require precision aim - the standard bolt spell actually homes in on enemies! - and combat felt a little sluggish to me.Compounding this is that there is a lot of combat, but all the enemies and environments seem to be basically the same. Once you've got your combos down, the only thing that brings any variety to combat is that enemies spawn with random \""affixes\"", similar to the unique monsters in games like Diablo or Path of Exile. This make choosing which enemies to prioritise important - which I assume is what they were aiming for, since there's not a huge emphasis on manual dexterity - but I didn't find it enough to prevent combat become repetitive fairly quickly. Some of the spell effects are pretty flashy if you like that sort thing, however.The other major part of the game is the crafting system, which is potentially interesting but more of a chore than it needs to be. Prepare to spend a lot of time on inventory management, because you're going to amass large piles of junk which you'll need to sort though using an interface which could be better. Again, it's not the worst but it could have been better. If you're really into min-maxing and comparing stats you'll probably love it, though.Overall I think this game is competent but underwhelming. It doesn't really have glaring faults, but I just couldn't get into it. If you love flashy special effects or complicated crafting systems and don't mind a bit of repetition you might get more out of it than I did.""}]"

On the surface it appears as another Rogue-like game where you are punished incessantly for non-perfect play, yet when you break that initial surface, much like entering the Unterzee (where you will be spending your time), the game reveals this beautiful tapestry of tension, poetry, imagery and unease.Sunless Sea is related to the web-browser game Fallen London and you can reference Fallen London for back story of the Unterzee (or visit the Sunless Sea wiki - though that can be quite heavy on spoiler material, especially for intrepid Zee Captains out there).   It has a very Lovecraftian feel to it with all the hints of deep horrors, madness and surrealistic encounters.  For those who enjoy the weird-horror genre you will more than likely greatly enjoy what is on offer here storywise.The game is very text heavy and you will be reading a great deal, if you don't like reading in games, this may well be a big hurdle for you to surmount.  The writing is wonderfully superb though sublimely poetic and entrancing.  It gives off a great Victorian era feel, albeit with that Cthulhu-esque twist to it all.You begin your Unterzee journey as a Zee Captain out of Fallen London (London that was stolen and relocated to the shores of the Unterzee).  You start off with a small sailing vessel, rudimentary weaponry and a crew of faceless sailors.  You will soon acquire/hire officers who bring a lot of story and personality to the game.  Officers offer various bonuses and all of them have varying story plots and interactions.   You being with the life-giving resources of fuel and supplies.  Fuel powers your ship and most importantly it's lantern, supplies allow you to feed your crew and keep their hunger at bay, though there are other....... options for a ravenous and maddened crew.The locations themselves are as much a character as any of your Officers, or indeed yourself. They all have a lot of story attached to them - some humourous, some sad, some eerie, some horrifying - all of them unnerving and a little unnatural.  As you explore you will reveal the Map of the Unterzee - for as long as your Captain lives this is how the Unterzee is, if he dies though the map will have changes and things won't necessarily be in the same location - unless of course your legacy allows as such.This brings us into the life, and death of your Sea Captain.  The game clearly states : Expect your first Captain to die.  While your Captain doesn't have to die, do not be surprised when it occurs and do not be saddened as your legacy will live on, if you so choose.  You can acquire better accomodation in Fallen Londer, write a will and bequeath things to your successors, in this way every failure can lead to a future success, one where everyone in your line has contributed - an epic journey, one that beautifully mirrors the way the game plays - slow, methodical and punctuated with elegance and horror.   Being a Zee Captain though isn't just about managing your lineage, it is also about managing your ever present crew. Your base crew are faceless and man your ship, but like all good Lovecraftian horror - it is the faceless who help provide that simmering tension - the crew can, at times, throw a spanner into your plans with an impromptu fit of terror, deity attracting worshipping or the impetus to find supplies.. now.  This interaction is largely through small information boxes that appear mid-journey offering you a choice of what you want, or should I say, can, choose to do.  Interacting with your Officers can be achieved by story plot/location visits, or you can initiate it through the interface of your ship.  As you gain Officers you assign them to their respective stations where they give you bonuses - ie Mascot, Chief Engineer, Ships Doctor, Navigator etc..  Officers bring a lot of story to the game, interact with them and reap the benefits.Finally locations can be interacted with.  When you dock at a location (Default is E to dock when close to a port/dock) an information panel is opened and from there you can interact with the location - be it a colony, shrine or another ship.The game is presented in a 2d top down view, interactions are through mouse clicks on information panels that open up. You have access fo a Captains Gazetteer - it has six tabs which allows you to access and interact with locations/information. (By default G opens or closes the Gazetteer). Through the Gazetteer you can access your journal, view your ship, look at shops or repair docks when in towns etc..Gameplay wise it is a rather simple affair, guide your ship around attempting to make a profit and solve plots with the rather meagre resources. The ship is controlled with the WADS keys - to turn or increase, decrease speed. The E button is your default interact button which you can use to Dock/Undock, sound the all clear from battle etc..Managing your resources is integral to your survival. Fuel obviously powers your ship, it also powers your lantern (of vital importance in the dark Unterzee).  The lantern burns a lot of fuel though and you may find yourself short on fuel and long from home - do [u[Not[/u] get stranded at Zee.Supplies allow you to feed your crew (and yourself) while at Zee.  Feeding your crew actual food is more beneficial then the alternatives, there are no fat crew on Unterzee ships, at least, not for long, for various reasons.Terror is a resource you will accumulate as you travel, events can randomly occur to rapidly increase or maybe decrease some terror.  Visiting Fallen London will always lower your terror some.  Collecting various stories/tales and venturing the Unterzee will cause terror to rise. How fast that rises depends on may factors. Littered throughout the Unterzee are buoys of light, sailing near these will produce a lower terror, they are sparsely distributed though. Having your lantern on will greatly lower the rate of terror gain, though it will cost much fuel. Finally no light and the deep of the Unterzee will gain terror very fast as your crew feel the horrors encroach in.  Reach maximum terror and you will go mad and that Captain will relinquish himself to the Zee.Echoes are the currency of the Unterzee, you can gain these via submitting reports of locations you visit to the Fallen London Admirilty, selling goods etc..  With the initial starting ship it can be difficult to make a living through trade.  That said not all trade is of a lawful nature and you may be approached by people who wish to employ you for unlawfull pursuits on the Unterzee - potentially profitable and dangerous.Secrets are another form of currency, as you discover locations you will gain fragments - these add up until they form a secret.  Secrets can be used to boost your stats, or you could sell them to a collector or secrets or you could use them to open up story/plot lines.You can gather Tales of Terror, Zee-Tales, Items of Curiosity and the liek which again allow you to turn in for a profit or unlock story.Best results are achieved not through random exploring - though early in the game this is unavoidable, but though deliberate planning and risk management.  Conserve your fuel and supplies (or preserve your delicious crew), calculate your risks and sail the Unterzee!  Fortune favours the brave, or is it cautious, one never quite knows in the Unterzee.  Maybe you will eek out a wretched living barely scraping by in the squallor of Fallen London, maybe you will discover a higher purpose, maybe you will slip beneath the waves in silence, maybe you will carve a path over the Unterzee guns blazing and returning the horrors back to the Nine Hells, or maybe you will find love and pine for them as hope slips over the rail and plunges down into the depths.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted February 9, 2014."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""250260"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Jazzpunk is a game that defies allocation to a traditional genre.  At it's essence it is an absurdist comedy intermingled with puns, computer jokes and various mini-games.  There are moments where you will laugh out loud, others that make you smirk and some that may just go straight over your head.  It's a comedy experience, but one that may not be suited to your tastes or the entry price point.The game is delivered in a 60's style TV/film presentation - flashy colours, big stylised letters, obtuse and poorly explained events and an over arcing plot of being a spy in a 60's interpretation of a somewhat cyberpunk world.   While cyberpunk depicted today is body augmentations, guns, guns, guns and a high body count. This is a depiction of late 50's early 60's sci-fi, robots and crazy gadgets in the world of tomorrow!  The presentation is very good and it conveys it's unique attributes very well, I haven't seen this style of introduction since the old No One Lives Forever games (another 60's spy type game).Gameplay wise the game is very simple, you cannot die and the pay off is in exploring everything to elicit the jokes hidden around or to even create them yourself.  It is best to avoid following the main quest until you have explored everything.  On my first play through (approximately 3 hours) I didn't discover everything and I made the mistake of going to pick up on the main quest again while doing side quests and then suddenly finding myself ending the level and missing out on the additional exploration.  You can interact with a surprising amount of the world and things felt rather intuitive in terms of control.  There were some blocks to gameplay though such as when I discovered a door a tried the ye olde tried and true knock that it didn't do anything.  Once I discovered the trigger for the area it was the exact same knock required on the door that I had already performed.  I felt that perhaps it would of been rewarding to have accidentally discovered that rather than being led directly to it.  The minigames are rather frequent and range from mundane to excellent, though I found that the better games were all towards the end of the game, perhaps to counterbalance the reduced humour in the latter stages.Replayability wise there is perhaps not so much there once you have discovered anything, thankfully the best mini-game by far is unlocked for you automatically when you complete the game - Wedding Qake.  It's actually a highly enjoyable rip-off of the old Quake experience, albeit fighting bots (who moan and complain in chat humourously) rather than other players.  I would guess that the short play experience is probably quite beneficial to the game overall as prolonged humour can make the player continually expecting increasing funny events which is very hard to maintain.So if you like absurdist humour you may find this game right up your alley, if you find such surreal things annoying or particularly unfunny then you best avoid this product.One last thing to point out, currently on Steam this is listed as $14.99 USD, quite a steep price for the short length of play and amount of content.  If this goes onto a Steam Sale I would definitely recommend it as a purchase (ie if it's around the 7.50 or lower mark), but at it's current price point it really is best value for those who enjoy this sort of humour.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted January 23, 2014."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""211600"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Released in 1999 Thief Gold is the re-release of 1998's Thief: The Dark Project the wonderful game from the sadly now defunct Looking Glass Studios.  Originally Thief was known as Dark Camelot and intended to be an action RPG type of game and you can see throughout this game where they recycled content from that original game - ie medieval influenced missions.  it later morphed into Dark Project when they found that the stealth aspect (championed by Paul Neurath) was a lot more entertaining and that a game involving stealth and thievery would be a better option.Rather than being a straight re-issue of the game it was an early form of what we now know as GOTY editions. It includes 3 extra levels: The Mage Towers, The Thieves Guild and Song of the Caverns.  In addition to extra missions it also tweaked the standard missions some minor tweaks in most and then a couple of levels receiving reworking notably The Sword (added more area - ie Little Big World), Undercover (story changes), The Lost City (enemy and story changes) and Down in the Bonehoard is retextured.  Furthermore Thief Gold moves the version up to 1.37 from T:DP's final version of v1.33.  On the old discs you also got a preview of Thief II and of course the additional mission the Blooper Reel (Lord Baffords Manor featuring entertaining bugs and humorous content)At present the cut scenes do not function on some systems, notably Windows 7, there are various work arounds available - they can be found over at ttlg.com (file is called Tfix_1.18c) or if you so wish you can always Youtube the Thief cut scenes.  I highly recommend you watch the cut scenes, not only do they advance the story and reveal a lot of twists and turns related to it but they are also beautifully crafted and remain a joy to watch.The concept of Thief is simple, achieve the mission objectives by the use of stealth.  Stealth in this game pertains to use of shadows, sound and movement.  To aid you in this you have a light gem in the lower section of the screen that indicates the amount of light you are currently exposed in.  Sound is highly important and was one of the first games, if not the first where sound was just as important as what you could see.  Footsteps on varied surfaces, the sound of patrolling guards and ambient noise all add a rich and extra layer of gameplay.  You need to take these elements and work within them or bend them to your favour to achieve your objectives.The game is set within The City, a steampunkish type era, like the Victorian era on the cusp of industrialisation.  The City itself is moody, bleak and dangerous, the perfect playground for the adventurous. There are several factions within The City all vying for control, the mysterious Baron of the City remains aloof, a figure of power and control but not involved directly.  The ambience of The City is beautiful and it's success is largely due to the presentation of The City, both aurally and visually. The story that unwinds also fleshes out The City.Comparisons can be made to Dunwall from Dishonoured and Dishonoured does indeed play like a Thief game and has that ambience, albeit the focus is on assassination and not on stealth and theft.  Dunwall though is the victim of politics that goes up to the highest level, The City feels more alive though.   There is no apocalyptic plague sweeping the streets and the highest power is not overtly tyrannical but the various factions do give \""layers\"" to The City, it feels like it has more depth and soul than Dunwall ever had, it is an entity in itself.The visuals are nothing exciting but they are effective enough.  The sound though is truly a thing of sublime beauty.  This is the first game where it was essential to have sound enabled and if possible to have a dedicated sound card (that again has kind of died out thanks to integrated sound on motherboards).  From the fabulous sound ambience to the classical Loot sound it is all very stylised and very integral to the Thief experience.  It must be said that the talents of the voice actor for Garrett, Mr Stephen Russell truly stand out as one of the greatest in gaming. He gives Garrett the very jaded, near misanthropic character that makes the game feel so immersive.  Garrett feels like what you would expect to be a product of hard life within The City it is conveyed wonderfully.  It is wonderful to hear Garrett go into his internal monologues during missions, throwing story, character and enjoyment at you.  Be warned though after sneaking through a level only hearing footsteps and ambience you may jump off of your chair in fright the first time his voice unexpectedly booms out at you. The difficulty levels change objectives and throw in variables such as not killing anyone and collecting a certain minimum amount of loot. At the easier difficulty levels it can be easy to roll in and kill all the enemies in a level, but by far the biggest challenge is to play on the Expert setting and try to adhere to the rules of Ghosting - ie don't let anyone see you, leave things as you found them (except for things you need to loot to achieve the objectives), don't knock anyone out even relock doors you pass through etc.. By and large the rules of Ghosting are self-imposed, a fun challenge to yourself, but a rewarding one.  Consider the missions (levels) to be a big playground at your disposal.The controls are standard controls for the era and you may find you will want to tweak them to match what you are used to playing today - ie alternating strafe and lean keys for instance and changing the walk and backwards buttons etc.  Combat is straightforward - use your bow to snipe targets or to shoot a variety of specialty arrows - water arrows to douse torches, moss arrows to soften the noise on surfaces, rope arrows to climb to other areas, fire arrows to destroy things, broad head to kill enemies/make a noise, noisemaker arrows to create a distraction etc..  The Sword play is simple, space to block and primary attack to swing the sword.  Hold it down for a stronger strike. By far the most useful tool though is the Blackjack.  This item is used to render guards unconscious.  Slip up behind a guard raise your blackjack and then bring it down upon their head.  Then get rid of the unconscious body - be aware that placing a body near a fireplace or in even a small amount of water will probably result in death to the unconscious party - bad if you are trying to achieve a no-kill objective.  So while dumping that body into an unlit fireplace may seem great, it won't be if a servant comes and lights it up :PAt the time of release the original Thief was described as a sneak 'em up (as opposed to shoot 'em up) and it is the precursor of all stealth games that you see today.  The graphics have not aged well, mods can fix that if you so choose and the controls can be quite archaic. But the story remains as beautiful as ever and there is a great deal of satisfaction to be garnered from this game. The reboot of the series, Thief, is to be released soon and while the reboot doesn't follow on from these stories - it certainly seems to take ideas from the series.If you enjoy stealth games, games with an interesting story and enjoy a challenge, then Thief: Gold is a game for you.  It does look dated now but it remains as enjoyable as ever to play.  Make sure you apply the fixes to get the cutscenes working (and improved resolution options) to really improve the gameplay experience for you. Tweak the controls as you need and you should find yourself become immersed in the depths of The City very quickly.  From the first time you pickpocket a guard of a key, hear that chiming loot sound or even your first close shave with your heart pounding in your throat you will be hooked on the game.  It really is a gem of gaming.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted December 27, 2013."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited December 27, 2013."", ""item_id"": ""22320"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Morrowind, the Elder Scrolls game everyone venerates as the best in the series.At the time of its release it was a sublime gaming experience and an amazingly fun journey.  The original base game was expansive, you could trek for a long time without civilised contact and just become immersed/lost in the rather alien environment that Morrowind offers.  It really was an adventure as you were never sure what to expect beyond that bend in the trail, behind that door or over that hill, but there was always something.Often that something was also + Cliffracer, probably the most annoying enemy to ever be seen in gaming.  Plenty of mods erupted to remove or reduce the constant flow of the hated creature.  Many a Morrowind player could still vividly recall travelling along and suddenly having the combat music start and then a squawk to indicate imminent Cliffracer attack.  That said, it also prompted many to play with the editing tools you could get from Morrowind and an excited community flourished with the toolset. A game that was great fun and you could also add your own stuff? Fantastic.The Character creation and RPG-stat side of things was more complex in Morrowind, or at least, more in depth.  You didn't just level a generic \""one handed weapon\"" skill you raised swords, axes, maces etc.. it added another level of complexity to your character.  You want to be an expert dagger wielder? Sure have at it! Be a shirtless Redguard knife wielder it's your choice!  Character creation is easy and best of all if you didn't want to be a generic fighter, thief or mage you could simply make whatever type of character you could so choose.  It was that kind of choice which help propelled Morrowind to its revered status.Even with its potential complexity it was also a rather easily accessible game for new players to the ES series.  ES games are wonderfully self-contained you don't need to have played previous games in the series and on top of that this was the first of the major TES releases to be in a first person perspective full 3D which just made it all the more wonderful.  You could quick create a class, get off the boat for the quick tutorial and be out of Seyda Neen and picking mushrooms and stabbing bandits in no time.In the expanse of the game you could be exploring the wastes as an Ash Storm bears down on you, delving into the sewers beneath ancient cities, exploring the dank caves that permeated the region, go crypt delving, skulk through the wonderful Dwemer ruins, hang out in the taverns or even your own stronghold.  Like all great RPG's there was a lot to explore and a main quest littered with side quests to follow.  If you don't want to follow the quest, hey there is still absolutely tonnes to do.Items in the game were wonderfully interesting as well. The Scroll of Icarian flight, perhaps the most wonderful thing to ever throw in the path of a new and unsuspecting player.  I missed them on my first playthrough way back in the day as I went drifting off by myself but oh wow the fun such a potent item allowed.   The game also features the wonderful recall and mark spells enabling you to mark a location and on casting recall to return to that marked location *sigh* such a beautiful spell for stocking your house or making that great escape from angry townspeople/plains people/city guards who you inadvertently attacked/stole from/grievously insulted.Compared to releases today, the graphics are old looking the controls a little annoying and the interface, well it sucks in comparison. But behind that you will find a very solid game that will give you a great many hours of enjoyment and RPG stories of your own.  The game is text heavy and you will be doing a lot of reading but there are voices in the game, just more as greeting/attack barks that sort of thing.  Yes you will get sick of being addressed as Outlander, especially if you are playing a Dark Elf from Vvardenfell who is by no means an Outlander.  The story is fun if a little RPG pedestrian but the enjoyment is in the journey not the end result.The offered expansions are good value, though I feel that Bloodmoon is by far the better expansion in terms of new gameplay options and locations.   Bethesda released quite a few free add-ons (that aren't included in the GOTY edition I believe) that added a few little quests and items (such as female armour, adamantine armour etc..) to the game and it can still be downloaded from Bethesda/Zenimax, afaik.If you can find this cheap on Steam grab it and give it a burl.  There are also a lot of mods/TC\u2019s out there for this game that give it more lush graphics and features if you want a prettier Morrowind experience.Edit: My play time records 7 hours on Steam lol :P Obviously this game was released and played prior to Steam being released.""}]"

This is however offset by new content.Understanding that the game is still in early access is important, there are allot of bugs and glitches that spoil the game. However they are quickly fixed and rarely does the same bug affect you more than once. Loading times for the game are terrible even on an SSD, this issues is what put me off the game the most having to preload my game 30 mins before I play is not fun.The game itself is fun and exciting, you have a totally open world where you must survive and live. The dinos are realistic and creative; they offer a great amount of enjoyment to this game! You level up as you play to unlock new items to build and endlessly farm to gain the materials needed to build new items.All in all the game is fun and enjoyable if you can overlook all the current issues it has, I have put well over 300 hours  into it and after about that amount of time it became repetitive and mundane, endlessly harvesting food and materials.If you are into survival games that require farming and RPG mechanics all rolled into one then this is your game!""}]"

As such, some gameplay ideas are not as well formed as they could be and some bugs persist despite ongoing updates & support. Perhaps the studio's vision is slightly greater than their grasp, but the support to date has been great and most major issues have been addressed (aside from few niggles).Of note, the simulation aspect means that characters in your group will take the initiative & do things for themselves, however the AI is probably not quite up to scratch in handling some of the micro associated with this clever macro idea. If you just don't like any loss of control at all (even when your machine is off!), then this may annoy you a lot - however is is reasonably unobtrusive and does add a degree of SimGame-like satisfaction; if your community is happy and well supplied then it will tick along nicely (the inverse is also true...), and there are endless opportunities for player agency to influence the community's state (!).The game answers your questions about how Zoey and the team from Left 4 Dead stay so well fed, and where exactly those grenade launchers come from. It is engaging, well thought out and likely to continue to be tweaked and refined.It reminds me of STALKER + L4D + Fallout Tactics, if that helps. Highly recommended.""}]"

You'll probably figure it out before the revealGAMEPLAY:Pros:- All of the Arkham City gameplay you've come to expect returns with a more refined gameplay experience ( Batman feels more powerful than in City )- Fighting Drones with the Batmobile is fun ( when you get used to it )- Fighting the bigger Drones, that require sneaking around, in the Batmobile feels very reminiscent of the Batman predator sections- Riddler Informants ( that need to be interrogated ) are randomly generated as you just run around the place, meaning there's no more \""Crap, I knocked him out - time to run away, come back and try again\"" from Arkham City- A few new gadgets, in addition to the many that returnCons:- Gathering Riddler trophies that involve the Batmobile can be tedious ( as you switch to Batman, progress the puzzle a bit, switch back to the Batmobile, move it and attach the power cable to something else, switch back to Batman and so on. Also, there are trophies that require following question marks along the ground that are revealed with the Batmobiles sonar-thing. These can be tedious as well as you may need to grapple up a section ( which means jumping out of the Batmobile ), or jump over a section of land, and you're not sure where the next question mark is, or if you've lost the trail and need to go back ) or downright frustrating ( one requires you destroy a bunch of riddler question marks in the Batmobile, but to do so you need to use missiles, or you'll run out of time and need to start the puzzle again. The catch? You need to be in combat to build up the meter to use them, meaning if you screw it up and need more energy to use the missiles, then you need to, tediously, drive around beating up bad-guys cars until you gather the minimum two bars of energy needed to beat the puzzle ). However, they are mercifully few- Not all of the gadgets are acquired via the story, some are literally just laying around, waiting for you to find them ( I'm looking at you, remote electric charge )- A few of the Riddler trophies/riddles actually had me stumped, some riddles required you search around for a little room that exists only to hide the puzzle solution ( which I don't think is entirely fair, but then again, that's just my opinion )TECHNICAL:Pros:- The game does actually run at 25-30 fps averageCons:- You will likely need to turn off a bunch of the fancy graphics options and maybe lower the resolution ( I played it at 1024x768 with none of the fancy options on, and everything set to low. I enjoyed the game immensely, but I also understand not everyone is able to enjoy a game at 25-30 fps with all of the settings turned down/off )OVERALL:Pros:- Good Batman experience- Good ending to the series as a whole ( and, I daresay, a good ending for the Batman mythos )Cons:- There are technical issues; you may want to consider any updates that have been released since this review, as well as what people have been saying on the discussion board, before actually making the purchase""}]"

As you climb you always need to be gripping with one hand, or you fall. Swing the camera with the right thumbie. Elegant and fun - you feel clumsy at first, but after a short while you're bouldering like spiderman. Control is just one of many simple systems that Grow Home uses cleverly and with character. All round good game design. Not super polished -  I had some clipping issue some times, but meh, it's just fun to play and I think will spawn more than one copy-cat.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted July 14, 2012."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""440"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""free, frenetic and full of vitamin pwnage.

The voice acting is excellent- the space marine commander who gives you orders is perfect, and serves to immerse you in the universe thoroughly. It truly feels (in spite of it's arcade style) like the grim darkness of the far future- I will be playing this game a lot in the future.

Instead, I'll talk about the rest of it so far as January 2015.This game is thankfully uncomplicated in its control scheme and gameplay mechanics, and the atmosphere of it is seriously tense and dramatic - perfect for dystopia effectionadoes.  The game is quite reliant on problem solving, and many of the methods for dealing with situations have results that seem a little unorthodox - which, while fitting the theme and story very well, can leave one rather frustrated.  However, for those of us who don't want to miss out on the rest of the story because of one little puzzle, there's thankfully a number of walkthroughs out there that can help you.  Alternatively, since there isn't much that directly hinges on doing things in a set order (that I know of anyway), the tactic of brute-force use-everything-with-everything and do-everything-again-just-to-see-what-happens thing can work.The combat system is fairly decent too, and while currently lacking in variety, due to the relatively low health and shields of your character it can be rather intense.  Also, quite fortunately, there are frequent saving points before combat situations so that if you die, you won't be too far behind.All in all, I like this game and I recommend it to anybody who's got a bit of time up their sleeves and an itching for a gritty and dark puzzle game.""}]"

It is in early alpha and it is hard to say whether I think it is worth waiting or picking up now.I personally find the game pretty fun and entertaining, but that is just my competitive side talking. The community is going to be a rough one. Lot of games with this \""Kill or be killed\"" mentality often have a horrible community starting out. Lot of people want to kill you because they are curious what you have and want to take it from you. It definitely brings the savages out in the world lol.I think, if you played DayZ, Minecraft and any other survival type game, you may like this game very much, but if the kill or be killed mentality is not for you.. then I would not recommend it. They have non PVP servers, so it may be an option, but majority are PVP.I really think the game needs a way to encourage people to work together, rather than get greedy and become savage bandits. But do so in a way, that does not affect the players negatively. I often like roleplaying with these kind of games, but due to the people out for blood, it makes the roleplay very difficult or impossible.

I have no problem with early access games if they follow a similar route with this. This should once again be  a clear example and proof that gameplay is more important than graphics. This game is not perfect, but it is much more fleshed out than the competition. Here is some positives and negatives.+You have skills like crafting, shooting, survival, outdoors, stealth, that you can increase with exp.+The map is a good size for now+You can craft and build houses with different items. Some recipes are unique.+The game offers a challenge+If you want basic roleplay and become a bandit, and kill other players, then you can+You can make use of your current groups on steam to build a faction+Did I mention it is free, with optional gold membership?-Multiplayer at the moment is pretty limited. I recommend evolve or Hamachi, as you cannot join servers unless you portforward- Crafting system is good, but a bit confusing at times. I have not quite figured it out. But I do enjoy the lack of handholding.- Zombies AI could use little improvements, overall it is good, but may be overpowered to some people. Melee weapon is required.-Graphics: Some people might find this a negative( I honestly do not), even though I think because of simple graphics, they are capable to deliver the great features. But some might complain it looks like kid's drawing. lol-Tutorial doesn't give you alot of gameplay elements you can expect in the game. Does not discuss most of the features.Aside from those, the game has a great start. I don't know if this is being developed by only one person, but if so..You manage to achieve the basic barebones of what is beginning of a game.

Most games with Zombies, do not contain enough survival elements anymore. This one brings that back  with the 3 game modes. Hunted being my favorite.One of the things is that this game does not try to be another DayZ or another FPS game with zombies mode. It is also not as sosphisticated and complex that games that try to copy those games.It has 3 simple objectives. Gather ammo and weapons. Fortify, and survive.

In fact, it is the opposite of good, it's a rage game. The only difference is that this rage game has the balls to charge you for this crap.One of the main selling points of this game is the music. Is it good? No, the music is annoyingly repetitive. Although I admit it does sound good for the first 2 levels of the game before you realise that it is practically the same thing over and over. Not only that, but there is no other sound at all. Just the sounds of jumping over rocks and trash cans. Also, there are these 'powerup' things that go from Hyper to Mega to Ultra to Extra, and they make the game sound more lively each time. Sounds cool right? Wrong. The music does get more lively until you get to Extra, which turns the music into low, slow sounds that break up your pacing and eventually leads to you losing the level. Speaking of levels...The level design, don't even get me started on the level design. First of all, no checkpoints? Really? I get that it is a kind of 'music' (if you could even call this music) game so you wouldn't want the 'song' to be broken up, but the game is so insanely difficult that it takes more than 30 minutes for a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 2 minute level. Who thought this was a good idea? ALso, some of the powerups are in difficult to get places, which is good for a running game like this. The only problem is that some of these powerups are almost completely impossible to get. One powerup involves you jumping down a hole then springing back up. The problem here is that the spring throws you into a wall, which of course kills you instantly.So, the rating is probably what you want to see from this random guy on the internet.2/10 - Not recommended to all who wish to keep their sanity.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted December 21, 2014."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""222900"", ""helpful"": ""0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": false, ""review"": ""At least they didn't release the same game, sell it at full price and add \""Riptide\"" on the end.Oh wait..""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted December 22, 2013."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited July 8, 2014."", ""item_id"": ""230410"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""You can be a space ninja.""}]"

The Tutorials are NOT very inviting, So I felt like I was going back in time when I had to force myself to read the manual. Yet the robotic tutorial voice is not so great, so it is very hard to follow the tutorial videos, they should have a replay button or something. It just ends and you think...\""So what did it just tell me?\"" ...Also the tutorials were not synched up to what I was doing. They start by a trigger event, but that fails to realise what I have done, very frustrating and I believe most of them had more than one area covered in the one time play, tutorial videos.This caused me to try different things at random and it didn't feel fun. I was playing a solo game against no-one like it said on the main menu to get familiar with the game. Unfortunately this leads me to thinking that there is really only one starting path to choose from, and setting up your base with the essentials just seem tedious, which is why Im not bothering to start a me vs AI game because I feel I need to know exactly how to play the game and know every technology path JUST so I wont die miserably, and even if I did I still won't be having fun with this game. Why? because there is no learning curve in my opinion, you have to know it all before playing it by reading up the guides on it, leading me to think that mostly this game was for the creator and people who play multi because there is many faults that need to be fixed.1. Interior doors should be closed and locked to begin with!2. I found a bug, after taking direct control of a robot in the field, I exited back into the RTS view, problem was that THEN the WASD keys stopped working for moving around the base in RTS view, luckily I had the radar reseached and built so I was able to continue by moving around with clicks on the map!3. Another bug! On the RTS view, you can only \""drag select\"" units, not a simple left click... ?4. The map seems to small for a 4vs4 game5.

As a huge fan of DayZ's gameplay model of bare bones, high risk survival, but not a fan of DayZ's infinite development progress despite getting over $60,000,000 in early access sales, this is exactly what DayZ would aspire to be in a beta build or even close to release. The graphics are rich and detailed, the engine handles hit detection very well, crafting is mature, weapons and vehicles behave well and whilst they're rare they're not too rare. Looting is also much more realistic and requires attention to scrounge through piles of things and scanning environments for things that look useful, rather than the DayZ paradigm of opening inventory and walking until ground items show up in 'items nearby'. There's other negative reviews where people say it's crap because they got shot on sight. These types of reviews reflect poorly on the game but they're really other player behaviour. Of course people will shoot you on sight, it's a hostile environment. Perhaps it you don't like the type of game where you need to excercise constant caution you should play a different game that doesn't have guns, or survival, or any form of competition. Sure there's plenty to still sort out, like putting car tyres in your pockets, but this game is miles and miles ahead of DayZ. Get it.""}]"

The truth is its a game about hammers, and sometimes electro shock weapons, but mainly hammers.The beauty of Red Faction has always been manipulating your environment.   In this game your Handheld Anti-Military Miners Edition Ruiner or 'Hammer' is the tool for the job.You spend most of your time swinging the hammer around destroying what you see fit. You will happily be reaping destruction, ruthlessly destroying all you see for salvage for that next upgrade within minutes of starting the game.  On my joy of returning to this game I immediately set about swinging my hammer around gleefully searching for that next scrap pile, accidentally destroying the gun turret fortifications of a hapless rebel on my reckless journey for materials.With the hammer you can knock down buildings and smash nearly everything that isn't the red Mars into tiny pieces.Great joy is found using it as a biazarre stealth weapon, destroying enemies with ease as you leap out from crumbling walls, or lure them underneath crumbling ruins before striking out the last support beam.The story progresses by doing missions or creating destruction to allow the rebels to take control of each district.It can be overwhelming initially for a new player, but you quickly get into the swing of it and set about playing the game the way you want with numerous vehicles, weapons and distractions.  A personal favorite distraction of mine is completing challenges where I aim to demolish a building as fast as possible.Really there's not as much to do in it as in GTA V, or Just Cause 2, but what it does do it does very well.  If you want to reshape the battlefield around you with either a mallet or hammer this is the game for you.Highly recommended!  Its a classic and is well deserving of a go.(ps: ignore my play time.  I only spent a quarter of my time online when playing this).""}]"

That being you have to play the notes slightly before they say to on screen or you'll miss them, so in that regard you can't play to the timing of the song very well, which is instrumental in a band, pun intended.Not gonna give pros and cons.Buy 2014 if you want to learn easier.

My first few minutes consisted of looting the plane and finding a place to set up camp. This in itself was pretty cool.

They ran at me, knocking me and battering me, until I took at 2 or 3 of the squad. As they fell, the other cannibals retreated. Days passed, and another swarm attacked. I lost consciousness and woke up in a dark cave. I found a rusty axe and looted the rest of a nearby table. I left to find the entrance of the cave until I finally reached it. I headed back towards my shelter and took the time to take a rest inside. I was woken up by another swarm of cannibals and I finally lost against them. A great game, awesome and intense. But I would love to see a peaceful mode or something, where you can play the game without as many cannibals if any at all. Myabe just a diffuculty setting that changes how long it stays dark, how many cannibals spawn and how much damage you take from each hit.

The environment too - they look nice but you can't really interact with them; there's either not a lot of visual queues, or there's too much that they seem to do something but don't.

I feel that the player should find a weapon rather easily, to facilitate progress. However, personally I have found I do not find a weapon for a long time, and have to fight off hordes of undead with fists only. This results in usually five deaths, before I finally respawn at NIGHT - and finally locate a weapon. My first suggestion is that the player either starts off with a lower tier weapon at spawn, or that they are common throughout the map - rather than the ubiquitous duct tape one can find. Secondly, I reccomend that the player be able to carry slightly more - I understand what the developer is trying to do here through item choice, but rather than limiting by both weight and item amount, what about just one? It is an interesting system, and not everyone will like the final decision made about it. However, keep in mind these are personal suggestions about the game from personal experience. Again, great game, fun, and requires some intelligence, as well as luck to play.""}]"

During the game, you take on the role of a captain of a spaceship and will usually fail horribly at it. But sometimes you won't. Sometimes you will get to the Last Stand (with a great deal of hope and lots of preparation), telling yourself that you will win and everything will turn out fantastically. 2 minutes later, you will admit a soul-crushing defeat and begin crying on your bed. When you stop crying, you will play this game over and over again and you will love every minute of it, because this game is absolutely brilliant.

Then i'll keep it simple.Dex is great game that is hard to recommend despite it being so good.It has so many issues, as well as some baffling basic design oversights, that it would easily turn off so many people from the very start.However if you dig through the dirt, mud and other various amounts of filth, you'll find something that truly shines with a LOT of potential, especially in comparison to what's currently on Steam as of late.The melee combat and shooting all packs a punch and is very enjoyable. The RPG mechanics are varied, robust and are tailored to how YOU want to play, as well as the story and world the devs created being extremely interesting and a unique take on the genre.Thing is you'll have to dig a through a lot of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to fully enjoy it. Dex is a bit like Alpha Protocol in that regard. Lot of potential, but is so bugged up the fudge hole that a person suffering from Crabs would cringe. It all depends on how much you can suffer through.For those wanting a proper review there's more after the break...//////////////Alright, time to go balls deep into Dex.If i had to describe what Dex is to someone i'd say this:Dex is a third-person, side scrolling RPG that has a large emphasis on a unique hacking premise with some shooting and brawling and even some basic stealth mixed in for good measure. The game is set in a original cyberpunk world where augmentations are all the rage and hacking is a good way to rack up some cash, this is all drawn and animated in astounding detail which creates a very interesting aesthetic.It's a little like if the original Deus Ex got drunk one night and knocked up Shantae & The Pirate's Curse, nine months later this red headed, freckle faced mix of both games pops out as an indie game available on Steam for twenty bucks.That Deus Ex comparison isn't unwarranted either. Dex is a full blown RPG with action elements, instead of an action RPG like Deus Ex Human Revolution. You suck at everything until you level that skill up, or get a specific augmentation to enhance it.For example: Do you want to carry shotguns and SMGs into battle and fire them with pinpoint accuracy?Better save up your skill points then!Want to be able to lock pick almost every single locked door in the game not problem?Grind your exp and then level the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up!Want to be able to coerce pimps into lending you their fanciest male hookers for a kinky bang-time at a discount?Level up your charisma, pick the right choice during dialogue, and have fun you perverted freak!Speaking of which, yes there's a dialogue system in Dex! Even if you have maxed out charisma you need to pick the way way of coercing someone at the time. Some people respond to threats, others respond to bribes, and others respond to flattery. Pick the wrong one, and you'd best reload a save and try again buddy! It works well, and always keeps conversations tense as you need to always pay attention to what they say. The writing itself is very well done and descriptive, kinda reminds me of the old cRPGs of yesteryear. The dialogue is also voice acted and...... here's where Dex starts to fall apart.The voice actors aren't bad at all and always suit the character and role their playing, but the actual voice direction itself leaves something to be desired. It always seems like they took only one take for each line and it can sound extremely amateurish and awkward at times. You can turn voices off in the option screen of the main menu if you wish, but then during cutscenes they'll be completely silent except for the bombastic (and rather nice i might add) score blasting over stock still images.While we're on the bad side of this i'll also add that some sound effects in general just seem to be completely \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing missing or non-existent! For example during the game you can sneak up on some unaware thugs and choke them to death, giving the same amount of exp for little to no effort as well as avoiding any possible injuries, but they make no sound! The chick you play as just dry humps them for a moment and they fall dead, again with absolutely no noise to accompany it, not even when the body falls down.If i sneak up on someone and snap their bloody neck in a video game, i expect to hear a sickening *CRACK* to go along with the action, it's just plain unnerving when it doesn't.Another thing wrong is the control scheme for both the controller and the keyboard and mouse. Some keys are just in a weird unnatural spot! 'Q' to dodge during melee??? Who was the pants on head \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 who chose THAT brilliant key placement?And i have never played a game, that had these few actual commands to input, that has forced me to use the '~' key.Also the jumping has some weird form of gravity that drops if you don't hold in spacebar until you fully finish the jump. If you let go too earlier be prepared to drop like a sack of bricks.The devs have patched the game so that you can rebind keys, so props to them, but this should have been thought out more clearly from the start.There are also a few visual glitches here and there, and some that really hinder the gameplay like the journal getting confused and \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing up. I guess it sounds like i really hate the game, but it's the opposite. There is a brilliant game here buried underneath some confusing design choices.While stealth is aggravatingly basic (walk behind someone and press a button to insta-kill) the actual melee combat is simple but satisfying and deep, with a basic one two punch combo, dodging, blocking, and special moves unlocked the more points you put into the fighting skill.Plus if you don't feel like getting your hands dirty you can always pull out a great big \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing magnum revolver and empty it into someones cranium as fast as you can pull the trigger. Skill points in the guns skill also unlock more weapons that you able to use, as well as reducing accuracy, recoil and stuff like that.Like previously mentioned there are other skills you can upgrade such as:EnduranceHackingLockpickingCharismaand a few moreHacking plays a key role in the story of Dex, and as such, has it's own mini-game dedicated to it. Without going into it too much it's fun, encourages thoroughness and skill, and never gets tedious or unwelcome.There is also an abundance of side-quests and the most that i have encountered are well done, with good writing, always worth the effort for the cash ( or other bonuses reward ), as well as having some various options of how exactly to complete them.I won't go into the story as i generally believe that the story in a game can fall apart if you know too much beforehand. Believe me when i say it IS worth your time.All in all, Dex is worth the time of any patient RPG fan. Especially those with a massive throbbing hard-on for cyberpunk such as myself, and ESPECIALLY those who are looking for something akin to the original Deus Ex. Even with all the problems i mentioned.Is it perfect? No, Mia Khalifa isn't perfect either but you can bet that if she was willing i'd jump her bones like a starving hound!Worth every penny.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted January 8, 2014."", ""last_edited"": ""Last edited May 7, 2014."", ""item_id"": ""264240"", ""helpful"": ""99 of 139 people (71%) found this review helpful"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""I originally had massive problems with running this game, and plenty of others did as well. In my frustration i wrote a negative review because of its near unplayable state.Interdimensional Studios themselves admited ( and apologized ) that \""Consortium's\"" launch was horribly buggy and thankfully this is no longer the case. With all their hard work and dedication to the project all bugs (game-breaking or just weird) are now gone. I intended on fully editing this review if the problems were solved and now they have.I can best describe 'Consortium' as a mix of the original Star Trek and Mass Effect with the shooting mechanics and engine of Half Life 2 and if that mix doesn't sound good to you ( or you didn't like any of these examples ) then it's hard to recommend. However if you're looking for epic 1st person sci-fi romp with an emphasis on story, dialogue, player choice story and wrapped up with some decent shooting mechanics look no further.'Consortium' is also the first in a trilogy and only lasts about 10 hours at the most, however it never feels \""too short\"" and i'm very excited for what's to come. The story is brilliantly written, the game has marvelous presentation and the characters throughout the adventure are interesting and their dialogue throughout it is well done. Combat is a bit like an old school shooter mixed with Half-Life 2 (which i find works well enough) but it's hardly the focus of the game.No, the focus of 'Consortium' is the interactions between you and the other crew aboard the ship with multiple dialogue choices and the dire consequences for most of them, and Interdermentional studios have done it brilliantly. Even with my previous frustration at launch it's obvious how far 'Consortium' has come and the Master Edition truly is worth anyone's time especially for only $20. This is the type of game i've been wanting ever since Mass Effect came out, and it certainly doesn't disappoint.""}]"

Now, obviously no one is going to buy this game for the gameplay because it is just about as simple as point and click games go (meaning it has a lot of pointing and clicking), but the story grips you by the lapels and eats at your brain with all the twists, turns and choices you make. The only bad thing i could say is that maybe they could have used more keys for action rather than just the Q and E keys, i mean i think after plaing The Walking Dead: Season 2 (and posibly The Wolf Among Us) my Q key will resmble all the zombie heads i smashed during this game.Final words: If you like the look of it or have had it recomended to you, you'd being doing the gaming comunity a diservice if you didn't have it on your library.""}]"

If you don't want to read the rest of this review then all I can say is just purchase it because this a game that I would love to forget about and start over with.Storyline:The storyline in this is just amazing and is one of the things that keeps you going and playing through this game, no matter how hard the puzzles are, and just when you think you have had enough it just hooks you back in again for more.Gameplay:The majority of Portal 2's gameplay consists of puzzle solving right from the start. At the start puzzle solving is relatively easy and quite simple, but once you start getting into it, it slowly gets more difficult as you progress through the test chambers, and they always keep it interesting when adding new elements to the tests every now and again. One thing is for sure though, you will find yourself getting stuck and maybe even a bit frustrated but a small break to re-gather your thoughts is all it takes to figre out a puzzle.Atmostphere:One thing that this game is best at is making you feel lonely. The emptiness of the ambience and soundtrack is really all it takes to make you feel alone, and this is probably one of the best features it has. The soundtracks that were picked for this game are just incredible at creating an amazing atmostphere.Coop:Coop is just a load of fun with your friends, it really is just fun to mess around with them, block their portals and just do whatever the hell you want. That's not saying that you can't be serious as well.Overall:I really do think that Valve thought this game out well, and created an amazing experience.

The game doesn't have a official host so players must host the matches and that is quiet terrible since some players don't have good conexions to host it.

My computer can run heavily modded and graphically enhanced Minecraft, Dayz, etc, but 7D2D crashes.This isnt much of a problem as 7D2D closes instantly and only takes about 10 seconds to open up as it loads extremely quickly.What IS the problem is that THERE'S NO MANUAL SAVE FUNCTION, so if you find a gun, build a house and store supplies, it can crash without autosaving and send me back an hour. However I do have a 32-bit OS, which may be the cause of crashes I don't know.I WOULDN'T BUY THIS GAME UNTIL IT HAS A MANUAL SAVE FUNCTION the lack of one is shocking in a game that rewards you for putting in time (e.g to contruct a fort, play around in creative, etc.) The autosave it does have seems to trigger at certain intervals, but there's no way to trigger it yourself or toggle it. And sometimes it works every 3 minutes, and sometimes it still dosen't work after 1 hour! That might be just my computer though.

If you buy this game, expect bad fps (even for typically good pc's, i'm running 6gb of ram and my overclocked cpu (running 4.0mghz), and i only run it on 'simple settings') and the occasional glitch in graphics and performance. If you can put up with that though, its an excellent game. The best way to look at it is like minecraft but more realistic, at least in vanilla mode. Personally I haven't tried any of the modded servers or the official servers because the reviews I've read about the online community disturb me a little, so I've stuck to small servers. If I had to give an honest review of this game, I'd have to put up two reviews. Once you get past the jumpy fps and occasional glitch, the game itself is solid as a rock. For the game I'd say 9.5/10, just need to iron out the wrinkles. As for the second review, (the community), while I have heard of bad players, the players that I have met online have been really good, so although not knowing what other players are like, I'd give the community rating at about a 7 or 8 out of 10, just to try and compensate for my lack of knowledge.""}, {""funny"": """", ""posted"": ""Posted July 4, 2014."", ""last_edited"": """", ""item_id"": ""440"", ""helpful"": ""No ratings yet"", ""recommend"": true, ""review"": ""Quite a good team game, hence the name; it provides a decent challenge against other online players and is quite entertaining.

Upon arrival at the Bastion, The Kid sees an elderly man, known to us as 'Rucks'. Now, this beautifully voiced man is the narrator for most of the game, and I argue, someone whom truly makes the game what we all know and love. Logan Cunningham, the voice of Rucks, has made an appearance in another SuperGiant Game that I will be writing a review for shortly.So, after chatting Rucks up for awhile, they decide they need something known as 'Cores', in laymans terms, they are bits of immense power that they will use to power and upgrade the Bastion. From here, The Kid's journey is mostly centered around finding these Cores and using them to power the Bastion, to further one of two purposes..Massive. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing. Spoilers.

This game covers alot of different play styles and is great fun with friends or by yourself.of course every game isn't without if flaws or boring parts. a couple of boring parts i've found are the massive grinds to get end level gear (although this might be boring, it can also be quite enjoyable). Dungeon Defenders Eternity took everything about Dungeon Defenders and made it even better.But don't take my word on it, play it for yourself and enjoy!!!""}]"

Firstly, graphically speaking, it is a gorgeous looking game and it runs at a consistent 60FPS. The game may look like a Super Mario Galaxy Knockoff, and the developer of this game has admitted to that, but personnally, I didn't think it was a bad choice for level design. Control wise, its easy to move sonic about and being able to home in on multiple enemies with the homing attack is certainly satisfying, but the game does have a hard time teaching you how to use its Parkour feature and the game can feel clunky at times. When you get the hang of it, the parkour can be a welcoming new gameplay feature to the Sonic franchise, and I think they should keep it for potential future Sonic titles. I find it strange that Sonic's natural abilitie to run around is mapped to the right bumper of my controller, does Sonic just not have the natural ability to sprint around naturally anymore? However, I do love the welcoming return of the Spindash, that little baby is still rocking my world, although I do wish it lasted longer that 2 seconds after charging it.Be warned, this game starts off simple and easy for you too grasp the basics of how things work, but slowly and surely, the game with put you to the test. This game will frustrate you if you are not patient enough to endure a lot of trial and error, levels will get harder, crazy gameplay elements will be thrown at you from all directions and you are most likely going to die a lot, so rack up on those lives, because this game is not going to show you any mercy. Also, don't feel surprised if you feel like the games many gameplay elements consist of strange activities, such as guiding fruits to blenders, because believe me, the game will eventually reveal itself to have levels built specifically for experimentation and player feedback.The music is definetly something to behold, wonderfully composed with a lot of great orchestration, rock and occasional heavy metal. Though I do wish Crush 40 or Cash Cash came in to do a song like they've done in the past, I guess their contract with Sonic games is over. :/Now, the one thing I hear people complain about constantly is the story, and yeah, it isn't overly complex or enjoyably silly as say, Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Colours, but with what the game presents us graphically with its simple yet beautiful designed with a simple Sonic must defeat Eggman/ The Deadly Six plot, I didn't feel like I was getting ripped off. The Deadly Six as characters, I don't hate them, they're just not that interesting, although Zazz cracks me up with every line he says.Overall, even though I haven't completed the game, while I find that the game does reek of experimentation and they're are some issues with the controls, I had a fun time with this game. Its is not perfect by any means, and for people who can't get into this based on the level design and the controls, I don't blame you, you probably don't have as much patience with games as much as I do.Approach this game with caution my fellow gamers, if you found this review helpful, I'm happy to have given my thoughts on it. Have fun and have a Good night :)""}]"

Like, REALLY good. First thing I noticed was the fact that thegraphics are incredible. At least for me, because I have a pretty powerful PC. The environment is VERY Doom 3-like, however I'd say the textures are much better looking. Everything else is exactly the samein terms of appearance.Gameplay-wise it is not as good. Walking is a bit floaty and you can't jump, as Space is the 'interact'button. Gunplay works really well however. While being slow to start off the game kicks you in thenuts with a big horde of zombies at the end of the first level. However while this pumps up the gamethe general gameplay is slow.Feature-wise it is very good. You can buy different items in the in-game shop with CREDITS YOU PICK UP IN-GAME. NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS. THANK JESUS HIMSELF. Anyways, the guns in thestore seem to be varied and they look very nice. Problems: - Had minor issues with menus over-lapping while running on my 3 monitors - No jumping - Slow gameplayWould I recommend it? YEP. Remember my comment about Doom 4 having some competition? Yeah, I was being truthful.

It seems pretty realistic for a game. It reminded me of an updated \""America's Army\"" game, which had the same realistic 1-3 bullets and you're dead mechanic. And that's a good thing, if you like some realism. It reminds me a little of paintball, except better accuracy and with real weapons. The \""suppression\"" feature is really cool, and reminds me of the effect that paintballs whizzing around your head has.I much prefer it to the various CS as the recoil/bullet spreading seems more realistic, and the loadouts are not related to success in the game. It's just a fixed budget of points and weight, to distribute how you see fit. This makes it more newbie-fair. The allocation of members of your team into a fixed breakdown of pickable roles is good because it prevents an accumulation of snipers on teams. Often the \""Support\"" or \""Machinegunner\"" role goes unused, which suits me as I enjoy playing it. Once you get the bipod setup lying prone, behind some concealment or cover, it's a lot of fun because the recoil is gone and you can suppress or kill. It suits a somewhat older gamer like me with slower reaction times, because as you fire you are suppressing and then you can eventually hone in and mow them down. Heavy armor often extends your life a bit.Speaking of concealment vs cover, that is definitely something you learn to adapt to. It's a lot of fun shooting through some corrugated iron or wooden boxes, especially with AP bullets, to kill someone crouching behind them.The emphasis on achieving objectives to win, points for taking objectives and killing opposition at the objective instead of just raw K/D ratio makes for a great teamwork environment. If you snipe, you snipe to capture the objective (countersniping or covering the objective). It's really fun with good teamwork, especially if someone who knows  what they are doing is instructing players what to do and boosting morale.I don't even notice that the engine is supposedly old, at least it was inexpensive and ran on my machine. Looks good enough compared to old games I am familiar with.""}]"

Where to start. well for starters, no matter how many other better games you find on steam, Skyrim, The Witcher Wild hunt ANY OTHER GAME! you will never get as much enjoyment out of them as you will terraria. You will never beat the classics such as minecraft, no matter how many times you tell yourself you dont like it anymore...... but tbh TERRARIA is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing amazing!! you think the producers of minecraft have it hard, OF COURSE THEY DO!! its a 3D game, everythings difficult. even tho Terraria is a 2D game it has so much more content including bosses, weapons, biomes, enemies, items, NPC's, tools, ores and A LOT MORE!!! like srrsly you think or minecraft, then think of everything is has. terraria has it but about 5 times more. ESPECIALLY items, terraria has like..... 50 times more items then minecraft. Minecraft just simply cant compete. with terraria you spawn into a randomly generated world with a shortsword, pickaxe and an axe. You find a tree, chop it down, make a house, make some background walls so enemies cant spawn in there then with the rest of the wood a workbench, some tools to mine better ores to make better weapons, look at wiki or do it yourself. spawn an easy boss and DESTROY!!! it with the AMAZING new weapons you have scavenged and made. collect its drops to save up copper, silver, gold, platnium coins to buy unique items from NPC's such as, awesome weapons and humorous items to make your gameplay even more entertaining. and just when you think its over a meteor lands, you go find its location, (attempt to) mine it without getting killed from burning to death or demolished by meteor heads, use the meteor armor, weapons and tools to go deeper underground to find and mine some gold. once you have the gold you make ingots and gold armor and weapons, get better weapons to go aaaallllllll the way down to the underworld (A.K.A HELL!! XD) to mine some hellstone! make a giant pathway thought the underworld, kill a voodo demon and get a guide doll, drop it in lava and summon the WALL OF FLESH with multiple attempts to kill it you will then basically have a new game.... (killing the wall of flesh unlocked hardmode) harder enemies, new bosses, destroy the demon altars with the hammer the wall of flesh drops, which spawns in new better stronger ores to mine....... ANYWAY i HIGHLY recommend buying this game. HOURS AND HOURS!!!! of fun!! i just.... this game is AMAZING!! please buy this gametell all your friends about this gameget them to buy this gamebuy this game for themWHATEVER you can you NEED this game to end your sad little life and make it a good oneanyway!!! :) Take Care ;)""}]"

I tend to partner up with friends and allies, grab as much C4 as possible, and raid every base in sight.

The bugs in this game can be moderately bad to scare-the-living-daylights-out-of-you by teleporting zombies on you and them being able to walk through walls. I think in this game there should be a few more things to do, because now there are a lot more options such as cooking and such but otherwise it gets very lonely in the game. Random towns and areas that contain absolutely nothing are very disappointing and the noises of wire fences rattling and zombie moans can give you a heart attack. Given the fact that this game is Alpha and there are a lot of bugs that need to be fixed to be able to play it with a lot of fun and enjoyment, it is a very good game and the set up of the towns and other villages etc are good for a game that you want to spend hours upon hours on. If you like running on a game for half an hour in reality to get to an airbase that you could get killed at and have to do it all over again, and lose your stuff, then this is the game for you.""}]"

The audio, the graphics,  the gameplay, list goes on and on and on. However, despite the sheer awesomeness of this game there are a few problems which i will address : -playerbase/multiplayer wait timeThe amount of time untill i find one player is beyond insane. Prior to buying lethal league i looked at the amount of players present and to my suprise i saw 600-700 people, i thought well, since this is primarily aimed towards multiplayer, the amount of players should fine. A few minutes later i reassured myself and bought it. After the totorial of lethal league i did not waste any time, i decided to play my first lethal league multiplayer match.........It took ages, but then a guy named Squaresx5 saved me from my misery, i pounced in joy breaking my chair in the process. I was so happy, even though i was a noob and knowing that i will slaughtered. -Replay valueI know the time i accumulated is trivial which results in my review being little to no significance, but from first sight, the HUD, the menu and so on i seem to be getting the same message all around the place. CONTENT? REPLAYIBILTY?  but dont get me wrong, it is immensely fun and a good time waster here and then, after awhile though... it kinda loses the appeal, hence people leave. This problem will ultimately affect the player base and the overall longevity of the game.Stuff to consider adding in the future:+stats+stuff to buy and enhance. new abilities?, potions?, weapons?.+faster multiplayer connection+new maps and new characters+new modes+and events+leaderboard?Personal ratingAudio: 9/10Gameplay:8/10Creativity 10/10Graphics 8.5/10Overall a solid  8.875/10 The review written was not to stop you from buying this game but only to inform you of the amount of improvement needed.
